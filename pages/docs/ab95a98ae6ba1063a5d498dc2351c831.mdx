More Schema
-----------

Our stakeholders have a new request. Now it isn't just an inventory database, it also needs to track orders:

- an order is a collection of line items
- each line item has a count and references an item in inventory

We can model this directly in Datomic schema without translation:

noslide

```clojure
(def order-schema
  [{:db/ident :order/items
    :db/valueType :db.type/ref
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/many
    :db/isComponent true}
   {:db/ident :item/id
    :db/valueType :db.type/ref
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}
   {:db/ident :item/count
    :db/valueType :db.type/long
    :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one}])

(d/transact conn {:tx-data order-schema})
```



```clojure
=> ;; transaction result map
```



`:db.cardinality/many` allows a single order to have multiple `:order/items`. `:db/isComponent` `true` tells Datomic that order items belong to an order.





More Data
---------

Now let's add a sample order:

noslide

```clojure
(def add-order
  {:order/items
   [{:item/id [:inv/sku "SKU-25"]
     :item/count 10}
    {:item/id [:inv/sku "SKU-26"]
     :item/count 20}]})

(d/transact conn {:tx-data [add-order]})
```



```clojure
result ;; tx result map
```



Here you see a **nested** entity map. The top level is the order, which has multiple `:order/items` nested within.

With this data in hand, let's explore some [more features of query](read-revisited.html).
