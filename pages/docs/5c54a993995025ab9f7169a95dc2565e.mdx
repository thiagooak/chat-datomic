JDBC
====

Overview
--------

The JDBC analytics connection is read-only and intended for analytics applications and is not low latency. It should not be considered a substitute for the [client api](../client/client-setup.html)for programmatic access to Datomic.





Presto JDBC Driver
------------------

To use analytics support from JDBC, add the [Presto JDBC Driver](https://prestosql.io/docs/current/installation/jdbc.html) to your classpath. For applications, add this dependency to your maven XML:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.prestosql</groupId>
    <artifactId>presto-jdbc</artifactId>
    <version>348</version>
</dependency>
```



If you are using a tool such as [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io), specify version 338 of the driver.





Connecting
----------

You can connect to a running analytics service via JDBC using the URI format:

```sh
jdbc:presto://<host>:<port>/<catalog>/<schema>?user=<user>
```



Replacing `<host>`, `<port>`, `<catalog>`, `<schema>`, and `<user>` as appropriate for your analytics system:

- `host` and `port` are the host and port of your [running presto server](analytics-connecting.html#running) (usually `localhost:8998`)
- `catalog` is the name of your [catalog](analytics-configuring.html#configuring-catalog)
- `schema` is the name of your Datomic database
- `user` it not currently used, but some tools may require that you specify it

For `catalog` and `schema`, keep in mind the [naming conventions](analytics-metaschema.html#naming-conventions).
