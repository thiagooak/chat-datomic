Log API
=======

Datomic's database log is a recording of all transaction data in historic order, organized for efficient access by transaction. You can access the log:

- Programmatically [from methods](#connect-txrange) on *Connection*
- Via [query functions](#log-in-query)

Connection.log and Log.txRange
------------------------------

[Connection.log](../javadoc/datomic/Connection.html#log--) returns an immutable log value.

```java
datomic.Log log = conn.log();
```



Given a log, you can retrieve an Iterable over a range in the log with [Log.txRange](../javadoc/datomic/Log.html#txRange-java.lang.Object-java.lang.Object-):

```java
Iterable<Map> range = log.txRange(1000, 1020);
```



The arguments are *startT* (inclusive), and *endT* (exclusive). Legal values for these arguments are:

- txes (transaction entity ids)
- ts (as e.g. returned from [Database.nextT](../javadoc/datomic/Database.html#nextT--))
- transaction instants (java.util.Dates)
- *null* (to represent the beginning/end of the log)

Each map represents a single transaction, and contains two key/value pairs.

KeywordJava ConstantValue:tLog.Tthe transaction t:dataLog.DATAa collection of datomsThe datoms implement the [datomic.Datom](../javadoc/datomic/Datom.html) interface. In Clojure, they act as both sequential and associative collections, and can be destructured accordingly.





Log in Query: tx-ids and tx-data
--------------------------------

The log API includes two convenience functions that are available within query. The *tx-ids* function takes arguments similar to *txRange* above, but returns a collection of transaction entity ids. You will typically use the collection binding form *\[?tx â€¦\]*to capture the results.

```clojure
[(tx-ids ?log ?t1 ?tx) [?tx ...]]
```



The following example query returns the count of transactions within the range \[t1, t2):

```clojure
(d/q '[:find (count ?tx)
       :in $ ?log ?t1 ?t2
       :where [(tx-ids ?log ?t1 ?t2) [?tx ...]]]
     (d/db conn) (d/log conn) t1 t2)  
```



The *tx-data* function returns the datoms associated with a particular t or tx. You will typically use the relation binding form *\[ \[?e ?a ?v \_ ?op \] \]* to capture the results.

```clojure
[(tx-data ?log ?tx) [[?e ?a ?v _ ?op]]]
```



Note the underscore binding. You should **not** bind the *?tx* position, as *?tx* is already bound on input to the function.

*tx-data* is the efficient way to get transaction data given t or tx. A common scenario is to use *tx-data* in combination with *tx-ids*, to return the datoms associated with a range in time. The following example query returns all the entities that were modified on August 1, 2013:

```clojure
(d/q '[:find ?e
       :in $ ?log ?t1 ?t2
       :where [(tx-ids ?log ?t1 ?t2) [?tx ...]]
              [(tx-data ?log ?tx) [[?e]]]]
     (d/db conn) (d/log conn) #inst "2013-08-01" #inst "2013-08-02")
```







Implementation
--------------

Datomic's log is stored as a shallow tree of segments, where each segment typically contains thousands of datoms. The most recent data in the log is also maintained in memory on all transactor and peer processes.
