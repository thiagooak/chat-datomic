Get Datomic
===========

You can find steps for downloading Datomic at [Get Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/get-datomic.html). For getting started, Datomic Starter or Datomic Pro is required. Datomic Starter is free to download and use, but does require that you register by creating an account at [My Datomic](https://my.datomic.com/login)first. Datomic requires the [Java 8 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

Once you've downloaded Datomic, unzip it somewhere locally. Throughout the documentation, shell commands are run from the root directory of the Datomic install. Change to this directory now, e.g.:

```
<pre class="example">
cd /home/user/datomic/datomic-pro-1.0.6644
```
