   [Storage](operation/upgrading.html#storage-only-upgrade)   [Production Compute](operation/upgrading.html#compute-only-upgrade)   [Query Groups](operation/compute-template.html)     `<button class="copy-button" data-clipboard-text="https://s3.amazonaws.com/datomic-cloud-1/cft/990-9202/datomic-storage-990-9202.json" label="Copy to clipboard" title="copy CF URL to clipboard" type="button">990-9202</button>`   `<button class="copy-button" data-clipboard-text="https://s3.amazonaws.com/datomic-cloud-1/cft/990-9202/datomic-compute-990-9202.json" label="Copy to clipboard" title="copy CF URL to clipboard" type="button">990-9202</button>`   `<button class="copy-button" data-clipboard-text="https://s3.amazonaws.com/datomic-cloud-1/cft/990-9202/datomic-query-group-990-9202.json" label="Copy to clipboard" title="copy CF URL to clipboard" type="button">990-9202</button>`  - Performance: Datomic now uses caffeine instead of guava for the object cache.
- Performance: improved fressian read.
- Feature: io-stats for transactions and queries. See <https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/api/io-stats.html>.
- Feature: query-stats. See <https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/api/query-stats.html>
- Fix: Attribute names that begin with an underscore can be used for forward lookups in entity and pull. Note that naming attributes with a leading underscore is strongly discouraged because it conflicts with the convention for reverse lookup.
- Fix: critical bug preventing transactions in 9188.
- Fix: pull performance regression introduced in 9188.
- Fix: Exception when using io-stats in nested contexts, you should no longer see "No implementation of method: :-merge-stats of protocol".
- Upgraded AWS libraries to 1.12.358.





2023/02/28 1.0.123 - Client-Cloud Update
----------------------------------------

   [client-cloud](client/client-api.html#installing)     `        <button class="copy-button" data-clipboard-text="com.datomic/client-cloud "1.0.123"" label="Copy to clipboard" title="copy CF URL to clipboard" type="button">1.0.123</button>`  - Feature: query-stats for transactions and queries.

2022/11/29 981-9188
-------------------

> The 981-9188 release templates have been removed (12/12/2022) per Critical Notice <https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/releases.html#critical-notices>.
> 
> This release introduced a problem in Datomic that could eventually halt transactions (but not Reads). All templates have been removed and de-listed from the docs and marketplace. The 990-9202 release contains all features in this release and replaces 981-9188. Recommendation: if you upgraded to this specific version is to immediately upgrade again to the latest 990-9202.

- Enhancement: [API Gateways](whatis/architecture.html#api-gateway) for client and application internet access.
- Enhancement: [Run analytics anywhere](analytics/analytics-configuring.html).
- Upgrade: Compute nodes have been upgraded from Java 8 to Java 11.
- Replaced: The client access gateway is no longer available; you can connect directly to the new client API gateway.
- Replaced: The analytics gateway is no longer available; you can run your own analytics node or cluster.
- Replaced: The solo tier is no longer available; the production compute stack now scales all the way down to t3.small.
- Replaced: The socks proxy is no longer available; clients can connect directly to the client API Gateway.
- Replaced: Each compute group now uses an ALB instead of an NLB.

This upgrade will cause up to one minute of downtime for each compute group. Make sure to perform this upgrade at a time that minimizes the impact of these disruptions.

In addition, make sure to read the upgrade instructions below *for each of the following scenarios that apply to your system today*: solo systems, production systems, developer connections, application connections, analytics connections, and web application (ion) connections.



### 884-9095 for Solo Users

Datomic no longer has a Solo compute stack. If you were using Solo you can upgrade to Production at no additional cost by peforming the following steps:

- Your web applications no longer need to go through a [web lambda proxy](ions/ions-reference.html#web-lambda-proxies). They can (and must) instead use [HTTP direct](ions/ions-reference.html#web-ion). HTTP direct is higher performance and simplifies your code, which no longer needs to call `ionize`.
- Perform a [storage upgrade](operation/upgrading.html#storage-only-upgrade).
- Perform a [compute upgrade](operation/upgrading.html#compute-only-upgrade), selecting the t3.small instance size (the default).





### 884-9095 for Production Users

If you are running Production, you now have a set of t3 instance sizes to choose from. Many users will be able to provision smaller, less expensive instances:

- Unless your compute group [needs valcache](operation/growing-your-system.html#valcache), you should switch from your current i3 instance to the matching-sized t3 instance.
- If you believe you were already overprovisioned with i3.large, you should consider a [smaller t3 instance size](../operation/growing-your-system.html#instance-sizes).





### 884-9095 for Developer Connections

884-9095 significantly simplifies developer connections. If you connect to Datomic with a socks proxy to the access gateway, remove all of those steps from your workflow. Instead:

- When you upgrade a compute group, enable the client API gateway.
- Configure your clients to connect directly to the client API gateway endpoint.





### 884-9095 for Application Connections

884-9095 significantly simplies application connections. If your application connections require managing security groups, VPC endpoints, or VPC peering, remove all of these steps from your workflow. Instead:

- When upgrade a compute group, enable the client API gateway.
- Configure your application clients to connect directly to the client API gateway endpoint.





### 884-9095 for Ion Applications with API Gateway

If you manually created an API Gateway for your ion application on a previous release of Datomic, that gateway will no longer work. You should note any custom configuration for refererence and then delete the gateway. Then, let Datomic create the API Gateway for you (preferred), or follow the updated instructions for creating your own API Gateway.





### 884-9095 for Ion Applications using Web Lambda Proxies

If you were using [Web Lambda Proxies](ions/ions-reference.html#web-lambda-proxies), then you should change to HTTP Direct or lambdas.

- Move the function to the `:http-direct` or `:lambdas` key in your ion-config.edn
- The [`ionize`](ions/ions-reference.html#ionize) function should not be used.
- Expect the appropriate input data for the type of entry point ([HTTP Direct](ions/ions-reference.html#web-ion) or [Lambda](ions/ions-reference.html#lambda-ion))





### 884-9095 for Analytics Users

If you were using Datomic analytics via the access gateway, you will now need to start your own analytics cluster. [Configure analytics](analytics/analytics-configuring.html) on any machine or cluster of machines (locally or in EC2), and connect to the client API gateway endpoint.







2021/07/13 884-9095 - Storage Update
------------------------------------

- Enhancement: The storage template now sets DDB provisioning to fit within the AWS free tier if your usage is low enough.
