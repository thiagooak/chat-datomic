Data Modeling
=============

Use `:db/ident` for Enumerations
--------------------------------

Many databases need to represent a set of enumerated values. In Datomic, it is idiomatic to represent enumerated values as entities with a `:db/ident` attribute.

For example, the transaction below defines an `:artist/country`attribute, and two initial enumerated values, `:country/CA` and `:country/JP`, ISO alpha-2 country codes for Canada and Japan.

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">[{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:artist/country</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/valueType</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.type/ref</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/cardinality</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.cardinality/one</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/doc</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"An artist's country of residence"</span>}

{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:country/CA</span>}

{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:country/JP</span>}]
```



The use of `:db/ident` on the enumerated value entities makes it possible to refer to the entities using their identity keywords, `:country/CA` and `:country/JP`.

The transaction below creates an artist named *Leonard Cohen* with the country `:country/CA`.

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">[{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:artist/name</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Leonard Cohen"</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:artist/country</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:country/CA</span>}]
```



The `:artist/country` attribute is of type `:db.type/ref`, so its value must be a reference to another entity. The `:country/CA` keyword can be used as a value because it is the identity of an entity, as specified by `:db/ident` in the previous transaction.

Attempting to use identity keywords that have not been transacted as referenced identities will result in an [anomaly](../client/client-api.html#anomalies).
