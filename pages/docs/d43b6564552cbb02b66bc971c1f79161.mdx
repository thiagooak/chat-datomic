Glossary
========

asOf
----

A database value as of a point in time. With asOf, you can reuse existing queries and rules to ask questions about points in time other than the present.





assertion
---------

An atomic fact in the database, associating an [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity), [attribute ](/cloud/glossary.html#attribute), [value ](/cloud/glossary.html#value), and a [tx ](/cloud/glossary.html#tx). Opposite of a [retraction ](/cloud/glossary.html#retraction).





attribute
---------

Something that can be said about an [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity). An attribute has a name, e.g. :firstName, and a value type, e.g. :db.type/long, and a cardinality.





attribute identifier
--------------------

An entity identifier that refers to an attribute.





basis-t
-------

The database t that is the basis for the current database, i.e. the most recent point-in-time that this database has seen.





cardinality
-----------

Property of an [attribute ](/cloud/glossary.html#attribute) that specifies how many values of the attribute can be associated with a single reference entity. Possible values are :db.cardinality/one and :db.cardinality/many.





caches
------

Nodes use a [multi-layered cache ](/cloud/whatis/architecture.html/cloud/glossary.html#caching) that consists of an object Cache, [valcache ](/cloud/glossary.html#valcache), and an EFS Cache.





client
------

A process that uses a Datomic library to obtain [connection ](/cloud/glossary.html#connection) to interact with one or more [database ](/cloud/glossary.html#database).





closed world assumption
-----------------------

Assumption that truth is what the database knows. Databases that intend to store data of record typically make the closed world assumption. Datomic adheres to the closed world model.





component
---------

A [reference attribute ](/cloud/glossary.html#reference) that is part of its [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity). E.g. your arm is a component of you, but your sister isn't. An attribute is a component it has :db/isComponent set to true.





component attribute
-------------------

See [component ](/cloud/glossary.html#component).





compute-group
-------------

An Auto Scaling Group of compute resources, either a primary compute group or a query group.





connection
----------

Client object that provides access to a database. Programs can use a connection to submit transactions and queries.





consistent hash ring
--------------------

Datomic uses a consistent hash ring to route transactions to a preferred Node per database. This is a performance optimization only: any Primary Compute Node can handle any transaction.





covering index
--------------

A covering index contains (rather than points to) the data. Datomic indexes are covering indexes.





database
--------

A database is a set of datoms.





datom
-----

An atomic fact in a database, composed of entity/attribute/value/transaction/added. Pronounced like "datum", but pluralizes as datoms.





datalog
-------

A deductive query system, typically consisting of:

- A database of facts
- A set of rules for deriving new facts from existing facts
- a query processor that, given some partial specification of a fact or rule: finds all instances of that specification implied by the database and rules, i.e. all the matching facts
 
Datomic's built-in [query ](/cloud/glossary.html#query) is an implementation of Datalog. 



domain attribute
----------------

an attribute used to model something in your application domain.





edn
---

The [extensible data notation ](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) is used by Datomic and other applications as a data transfer format.





EFS cache
---------

A cache of segments in EFS that will typically contain the entirety of all databases, eliminating the need to read from S3.





ensure
------

an operation that guarantees the existence and correct configuration of a resource. Ensure is typically built out of AWS primitives that create, query, and update resources.





entity
------

The first component of a [datom ](/cloud/glossary.html#datom), specifying who or what the datom is about. Also the collection of datoms associated with a single entity, as in the Java type, Entity.





entity id
---------

An opaque identifier assigned by Datomic that uniquely identifies an entity. Entity ids are integers for efficiency, but application programs should treat them as opaque ids.





entity identifier
-----------------

a value that identifies an entity. Can be an entity id, an ident, or a lookup ref.





environment
-----------

an instantiated set of all the resources need to run an application.





external key
------------

a unique identifier external to Datomic. Typical external key types are email address, UUID, and URI. External key attributes should be declared as db.unique/identity.





epoch
-----

Period of time bounded by writing index to storage. During an epoch, indexing is done in memory. At epoch boundaries, the in-memory index is merged with the persistent index, and a new persistent index is written to the storage service (without blocking the system).





fact
----

See [datom ](/cloud/glossary.html#datom).





Fressian
--------

 [Fressian ](https://github.com/Datomic/fressian/wiki/Rationale) is an extensible binary format that is used everywhere data is serialized by Datomic: on the wire, at rest, and in caches. Fressian is designed to be:

- self-describing
- language-independent
- extensible
- simple to implement and consume
- compact and fast
- friendly to dynamic and static languages
- compressible in domain-specific ways
 




keyword
-------

Data type representing a name, e.g. :email or (with namespace) :customer/email .





ident
-----

A value of type :db/ident that uniquely identifies an [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity).





index
-----

Sorted collection of datoms. Indexes are named by the order in which datom components are used for sort, e.g. An index that sorts first by [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity), then [attribute ](/cloud/glossary.html#attribute), then [value ](/cloud/glossary.html#value), then [tx ](/cloud/glossary.html#tx) is called EAVT.





infrastructure
--------------

The set of all environments for an application.





ions
----

Your application code, running on Datomic compute nodes.





lookup-ref
----------

A list containing a unique attribute and a value that identifies an entity.





LRU
---

Least Recently Used





namespace
---------

Prefix portion of a [keyword ](/cloud/glossary.html#keyword) used to make the keyword globally unique. Namespaces serve a similar function to table names in a relational store, without imposing any obligations or limitations, e.g. an entity can have attributes from more than one namespace.





object cache
------------

Nodes maintain an on-heap cache of segments containing the most recently used datoms.





parameters
----------

named slots for application configuration data.





primary compute stack
---------------------

a CloudFormation stack providing computational resources. Every Datomic system has a single primary compute stack, and may also have multiple query groups.





pull
----

a declarative way to make hierarchical selections of information about entities





query
-----

Datomic's Datalog system. A query finds [values ](/cloud/glossary.html#value) in a [database ](/cloud/glossary.html#database) subject to the given constraints, and is specified as [edn ](/cloud/glossary.html#edn).





query group
-----------

An AutoScaling Group (ASG) of nodes used to dedicate bandwidth, processing power, and caching to particular jobs. Unlike sharding, query groups never dictate who a client must talk to in order to store or retrieve information. Any node in any group can handle any request.





reference
---------

An attribute that refers to another entity. References always have the value type db.type/ref.





reference attribute
-------------------

See [reference ](/cloud/glossary.html#reference).





retraction
----------

An atomic fact in the database, dissociating an [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity) from a particular [value ](/cloud/glossary.html#value) of an [attribute ](/cloud/glossary.html#attribute). Opposite of an [assertion ](/cloud/glossary.html#assertion).





rule
----

A named group of [query ](/cloud/glossary.html#query) constraints, to allow re-use of logic across queries.





storage resources
-----------------

The durable elements managed by a Datomic system.





system
------

A complete Datomic installation, consisting of storage resources, a primary compute stack, and optional query groups.





schema
------

The set of possible attributes that can be associated with entities. Any entity can have any attribute.





schema attribute
----------------

a built-in attribute used to define schema, e.g. all attributes are named by :db/ident.





segment
-------

Indexes store datoms as a tree of segments, where the leaf nodes contain a few thousand datoms each.





storage-service
---------------

Subsystem responsible for persistence. Datomic Cloud uses DynamoDB as its storage service.





time-point
----------

Data structure that can be resolved to a point in time in a database. Can be a database t, a tx, or a date.





t
-

A point in time in a database. Every transaction is assigned a numeric t value greater than any previous t in the database, and all processes see a [consistent ](/cloud/transactions/acid.html/cloud/glossary.html#consistency) succession of ts.





tx
--

An [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity) representing a [transaction ](/cloud/glossary.html#transaction). Every [datom ](/cloud/glossary.html#datom) in a Datomic database includes the tx that created it, allowing recovery of the entire history of the database. Transactions are automatically associated with wall-clock time, but are otherwise ordinary entities. In particular, application code can make additional assertions about transactions.





transaction
-----------

An atomic unit of work in a database. All Datomic writes are transactional, fully serialized, and ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable).





transaction function
--------------------

a function that runs inside a transaction, taking the current database value plus user arguments and expanding into data to be added by the transaction.





transaction log
---------------

an accumulate-only log of all transactions, stored in DynamoDB.





tuple
-----

An ordered list of elements. Datomic queries return sets of tuples.





unique
------

Attribute of an [attribute ](/cloud/glossary.html#attribute). Each [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity) that has a [value ](/cloud/glossary.html#value) for a `:db/unique` attribute must have a different value. `:db/unique` has two possible values

- db.unique/value: attempts to assert a duplicate value will fail
- db.unique/identity: attempts to assert a duplicate identity will [upsert ](/cloud/glossary.html#upsert)
 




upsert
------

Either insert or update an [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity), depending on whether the unique entity already exists.





valcache
--------

An SSD-backed cache of segments. Valcache is similar in performance to memcached but durable and capacious.





value
-----

Something that does not change, e.g. 42, John, or [inst "2012-02-29". A ](/cloud/glossary.html#inst)[datom ](/cloud/glossary.html#datom) relates an [entity ](/cloud/glossary.html#entity) to a value through an [attribute ](/cloud/glossary.html#attribute).





value type
----------

Attribute of an [attribute ](/cloud/glossary.html#attribute) that specifies the data structure that can be stored in the attribute. The value type determines how a [value ](/cloud/glossary.html#value) is

- serialized
- sorted for indexing
- represented in a programming language type
