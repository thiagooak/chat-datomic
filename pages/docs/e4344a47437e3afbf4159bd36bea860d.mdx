Setup
=====

Clone the sample project
------------------------

```
<pre class="src src-sh">git clone https://github.com/Datomic/ion-starter.git
```



The [ion-starter](https://github.com/Datomic/ion-starter) project contains a complete ion-based application. To begin the tutorial, clone the ion-starter project.





Set application name
--------------------

Ions are deployed with an [application name](../ions/ions-reference.html#application-name) that must match your compute group.

Edit the `resources/datomic/ion-config.edn` file and set the `:app-name` to your application name.

> Multiple compute groups can share the application name. The compute groups that you can deploy to, for that application, are displayed after a successful [push operation](push-and-deploy.html#push).





Install the ion-dev tools
-------------------------

Make sure you have [installed the ion-dev tools](../operation/howto.html#ion-dev).

Before [deploying](push-and-deploy.html), learn to [develop at the REPL](develop.html).
