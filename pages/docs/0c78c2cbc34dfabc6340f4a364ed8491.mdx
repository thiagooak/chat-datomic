Transactor
==========

Running the Transactor
----------------------

A Datomic transactor performs ACID transactions for a set of databases. You can launch a transactor for one or more databases with the bin/transactor script in the datomic directory:

```
<pre class="src src-bash">bin/transactor path/to/transactor-template.properties
```



The transactor properties file needs to include *license-key* from your my.datomic registered account. For information on launching a second transactor for high availability, see [configuring high availability](../operation/ha.html).

If you set a `pid-file` in the transactor properties file, Datomic will write the current process ID to that file on startup.

The transactor startup script accepts JVM arguments, but please note that JVM args other than `-Xmx` and `-Xms` passed to `bin/transactor` (including Java system properties passed via `-D`) override Datomic's recommended Java options, including the GC settings.

### Health Check Endpoint

A web endpoint for health check is **not** needed for the Datomic transactor. The Datomic transactor is not a web application, and Datomic [High Availability](../operation/ha.html) takes care of transactor health automatically.

However, some tools have a checklist requirement that all processes provide a health check endpoint. If you need one, Datomic Pro lets you set a health check host and port in the transactor properties file:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">ping-host=localhost
ping-port=9999
```



Or on the command line:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">bin/transactor -Ddatomic.pingHost=localhost -Ddatomic.pingPort=9999 {etc.}
```



When the health check is enabled, Datomic will respond with a 2xx status code to HTTP requests for {host}:{port}/health, e.g.

```
<pre class="src src-sh">wget localhost:9999/health
```



```
<pre class="src src-sh">=> HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
```









Stopping the Transactor
-----------------------

The transactor does not perform any kind of cleanup, and can therefore be stopped any way you like. You can kill a Datomic transactor with a termination signal, e.g. `SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`, or `SIGKILL`. For example:

```
<pre class="src src-sh"><span style="color: #483d8b;">kill</span> $(DATOMIC_PROCESS_ID)
```



If you have an [HA standby](../operation/ha.html), it will take over transactions automatically when you kill an active transactor.
