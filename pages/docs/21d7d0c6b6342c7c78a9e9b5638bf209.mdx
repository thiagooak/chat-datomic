Turning Off Unused Compute Resources
====================================

While you can [delete a compute stack](../operation/deleting.html#deleting-stacks) at any time without loss of data, it is often be useful to instead temporarily turn down unused compute capacity in a Datomic system. This is achieved by setting the scaling capacity targets for your compute group's auto scaling group to 0:

Adjusting the ASG
-----------------



### CloudFormation

- Go to [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
- Select the stack that you want to adjust the ASG on.
- Click "Stack Actions".
- Click "Update".
- Select "Use current template".
- Click "Next".
- Make your changes in the "Auto Scaling Configuration" section. 
    - Ensure that the other settings match your desired stack configuration.
    - "Minimum number of instances during update" should always be 1 fewer than "Maximum instances".
- Click "Next".
- Click "Next".
- Acknowledge any capabilities listed.
- Click "Update Stack".





### AWS Console (Legacy)

Select your stack (query group or primary compute group) in the [Auto Scaling Group Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/home#AutoScalingGroups:view=details) and click the "Edit" button:

In the dialog box that appears, set the *Desired Capacity*, *Min*, and *Max* to 0 and click "Save".

The ASG will terminate all nodes of that compute or query group without removing any of the other system resources. When you wish to re-activate your capacity, edit the same ASG and set the scaling capacity targets back to their original values.

### CLI Tools - Solo Topology (Legacy)

> This section only applies to [Datomic 781-9041](../changes.html#781-9041) and lower.

The [`datomic solo`](cli-tools.html#solo) CLI Tool command can be used to set the ASG to 0 or 1 for [Solo Topology Systems](../whatis/architecture.html#solo-topology).
