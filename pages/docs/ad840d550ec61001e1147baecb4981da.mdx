Outer Joins
===========

In the relational database world, outer joins allow you to return relations even when data is missing from one side of a join. For example, you might want all of the [mbrainz](https://github.com/Datomic/mbrainz-importer#readme) artists and their start years, including artists who do not even have a start year.

In Datomic, you can find the entities you want with [datalog](../query/query-data-reference.html), and then make an independent decision about which details you want to [pull](../query/query-pull.html). The following example uses query to find the artists, and then plugs in a pull pattern to get both the artist name and start year:

```clojure
(def find-expr '[:find (pull ?e details-expr)
                 :in $ details-expr
                 :where [?e :artist/name]])
(def details-expr [:artist/name :artist/startYear])
(d/q find-expr db details-expr)
```



The query/pull separation also makes it easy to reuse query and pull logic independently.

Datomic also includes the [get-else query function](../query/query-data-reference.html#get-else), which is closer to a literal outer join in that you can reference a possibly-missing attribute in directly in datalog, specifying an alternate value when the attribute is missing. The example below replaces a missing start year with "Unknown".

```clojure
[:find ?e ?name ?year
 :where
 [?e :artist/name ?name]
 [(get-else $ ?e :artist/startYear "Unknown") ?year]]
```
