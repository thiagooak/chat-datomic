Local Dev and CI with dev-local
===============================

With Datomic dev-local you can develop and test applications with minimal connectivity and setup. Get the dev-local library, add it to your classpath, and you have full access to the [Client API](client/client-api.html). This allows you to:

- Develop and test Datomic Cloud applications without connecting to a server and [without changing your application code](#divert-system).
- Create [small, single-process](#limits) Datomic applications and libraries.

Dev-local is available at no cost. Note that dev-local is not redistributable. If you make Datomic apps/libs for others to use they must get a copy of dev-local themselves.

This document includes everything you need to know to use dev-local:

- how to [get and configure](#getting-started) dev-local
- how to [add dev-local to your classpath and create a client](#using)
- how to create [durable](#durability) and [in-memory](#memdb) databases
- [API](#api) for using dev-local as a test system for Datomic Cloud
- operational [limits](#limits)
- the [changelog](#change-log)

Setup
-----

Datomic dev-local is part of Cognitect dev-tools. [Get the latest version](https://cognitect.com/dev-tools) of dev-tools and unzip it. Then install dev-local in your local maven repo:

```
<pre class="src src-example">./install
```





### Configure Local Storage

By default, dev-local stores all databases under a common storage directory. To specify this directory, create a `.datomic/dev-local.edn` file in your home directory, containing a map with `:storage-dir` and an absolute path:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:storage-dir</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"/full/path/to/where/you/want/data"</span>}
```







### Maven

When you request [dev-tools](https://cognitect.com/dev-tools), your download email also includes instructions for adding the dev-tools maven repository to your project.







Using dev-local
---------------

There are two steps to use dev-local: add the dev-local library to your classpath and create a local client.

To add dev-local to your classpath, add a `com.datomic/dev-local`entry to your [deps.edn file](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli).

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">{com.datomic/dev-local
 {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:mvn/version</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"1.0.243"</span>}}
```



The dev-local dependency is all you need for using dev-local.

There are two ways to get a local client:

- you can explicitly request a local client
- you can *divert* requests for Datomic Cloud clients to use local storage for development and testing

To explicitly request a local client, pass a map to `d/client` with

- `:server-type :dev-local`
- a `:system` name,

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a0522d;">require</span> '[datomic.client.api <span style="color: #008b8b;">:as</span> d])
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">client</span> (d/client {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:server-type</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:dev-local</span>
                       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:system</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"dev"</span>}))
```



If you are using dev-local to develop and test a Datomic Cloud application, [add the client-cloud dependency](client/client-api.html#deps) to your project. Then, to divert an existing Datomic Cloud system to dev-local, call [divert-system](#divert-system):

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a0522d;">require</span> '[datomic.dev-local <span style="color: #008b8b;">:as</span> dl])
(dl/divert-system {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:system</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"production"</span>})

<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">existing requests for Cloud system will be served locally!</span>
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">client</span> (d/client {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:system</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"production"</span>
                       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:server-type</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:ion</span>
                       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:region</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"us-east-1"</span>
                       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:endpoint</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"https://ljfrt3pr18.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"</span>}))
```



You can also use [import-cloud](#import-cloud) to import data from Datomic Cloud to local storage.

If you are new to Datomic, you can now work through the [tutorial](tutorial/tutorial.html).



### Sample Data

`datomic-samples` is a set of databases that are used throughout these Datomic docs and the [Day of Datomic](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/day-of-datomic-cloud) tutorials. To install the datomic samples on your local computer:

- Get [dev-local](dev-local.html).
- Download the latest [(2020-07-10) datomic-samples.zip](https://datomic-samples.s3.amazonaws.com/datomic-samples-2020-07-07.zip).
- Unzip the datomic-samples zip into your [storage dir](dev-local.html#getting-started).

You can connect and use them by setting your dev-local system name to "datomic-samples":

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a0522d;">require</span> '[datomic.client.api <span style="color: #008b8b;">:as</span> d])
(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">client</span> (d/client {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:server-type</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:dev-local</span>
                       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:system</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"datomic-samples"</span>}))
(d/list-databases client {})
=> [<span style="color: #8b2252;">"mbrainz-subset"</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"solar-system"</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"social-news"</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"movies"</span> ...]
```









Durability
----------

dev-local stores data to your local filesystem, in directories under the `:system` you specify when creating a dev-local client.

Each database will store transactions in a directory named `<storage-dir>/<system-name>/<database-name>`. You can "backup" or "restore" a dev-local database simply by copying the database directory.





Memdb
-----

Sometimes durable storage is unnecessary and/or inconvenient. For example, a CI system may have no need of data after the tests run and no access to a file system.

You can force dev-local to use a memory-only database by passing `:storage-dir :mem`to the map you pass when creating a client, as shown in the example below:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">client</span> (d/client {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:server-type</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:dev-local</span>
                       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:storage-dir</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:mem</span>
                       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:system</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"ci"</span>}))
```







API
---

Most usage of dev-local should be via portable Client API calls. Capabilities that are specific to dev-local are available through the `datomic.dev-local` namespace:

- [divert-system](#divert-system) to develop and test Datomic Cloud applications against dev-local
- [release-db](#release-db) to release [memory used by a database](#limits)
- [import-cloud](#import-cloud) to import a Cloud database for dev-local use

All dev-local API calls take a single arg-map argument.

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(import-cloud arg-map)
(divert-system arg-map)
(release-db arg-map)
```





### divert-system

Diverts subsequent [d/client](https://docs.datomic.com/client-api/datomic.client.api.html#var-client/client) calls for system to local storage. arg-map has the following keys:

KeyValueRequired:systemthe system to divertyes:storage-diroverrides :storage-dir in ~/.datomic/dev-local.edn 



### release-db

Closes the connection to a database and releases the memory used by it. Values of that database can no longer be used. arg-map has the following keys:

KeyValueRequired:systemsystem nameyes:db-namedatabase nameyes:storage-diroverrides :storage-dir in ~/.datomic/dev-local.edn 



### import-cloud

Import a Datomic Cloud database into dev-local. arg-map has the following keys:

KeyValueRequired:sourcearg map for (Cloud) d/client merged with arg map for d/connectyes:destarg map for (dev-local) d/client merged with arg map for d/connectyes:filterfilter spec limits datoms to import A filter spec has the following keys, all optional:

KeyValue:beforet - include only txes before t, exclusive:sincet - include only txes after t, inclusive:include-attrsmap of attr -&gt; filter:exclude-attrsvector of attrs to be excluded`:include-attrs` keys are either fully-qualified attribute names or a namespaced keyword with \* as a name (includes all attrs in namespace, e.g. `:order/*`).

`:include-attrs` filters are maps with optional `:before` and `:since` keys limiting the time range for attributes as per before/since above.

Schema attributes are always included. When a filter spec is present:

- All other attributes must be included explicitly.
- Excludes take precedence over includes.

You can re-import to get more recent data if you have not transacted locally. You cannot import to a database that currently has an open connection.

The following example imports a customer database, including

- all schema
- all history of customers (except their secrets!)
- orders since May 2020

           <span style="color: #008b8b;">:exclude-attrs</span> [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:customer/secret</span>]}})
```









Limits
------

- dev-local is in-process with your application code, and has all the tradeoffs (vs. a server or cluster) that this implies.
- dev-local requires 32 bytes of JVM heap per datom. You should plan your application with this in mind, while also leaving memory for your application's use.
- dev-local relies on OS page caching for performance, so leave some RAM available (i.e. not allocated to JVM heap) for this.
- dev-local limits the total number of datoms in a transaction to 105.
- dev-local limits strings to 4096 characters.

dev-local is best suited for small, single process applications. For larger projects, [create a Datomic Cloud system](getting-started/start-system.html).
