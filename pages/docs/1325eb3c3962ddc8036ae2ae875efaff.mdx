Query Stats
===========

Everything about query-stats is alpha and subject to change in future releases.

Background
----------

Datomic evaluates query clauses in the order you specify them (with the exception of a few reorderings that are guaranteed winners, e.g. pushing predicates). You can take advantage of this control to choose a performant clause ordering, e.g. putting more selective clauses earlier in a query.





Problem
-------

You may not know which clauses are more selective. One measure of clause selectivity is the count of rows flowing in and out of each clause. Another measure is the boundness of variables, which helps to limit work done in later clauses.





Approach
--------

When you request query-stats, Datomic monitors your query as it runs, returning a map with the

- clause ordering
- count of rows flowing in and out of each clause
- boundness of variables in and out of each clause
- predicates used in each clause
- possible optimizations (expansions and warnings)

To request query-stats, add a `:query-stats` key to your query map. Datomic will return the query result set under the `:ret` key and a query-stats map under the `:query-stats` key.

Requesting query-stats adds some overhead to query processing and should be used outside of production code.





The query-stats map
-------------------

The query-stats map and its submaps are open to extension at any time, and you may see additional keys not documented here.

The query-stats map will have the following keys:

KeyDescription:queryThe query you provided.:phasesSubqueries of the query in the order they were executed. See [:phases](#phases)



`:phases`
---------

KeyDescription:schedClauses of the subquery in the order they were executed.:clausesFor each clause, information about row counts and bindings. See [:clauses](#clauses)



`:clauses`
----------

KeyDescription:clauseThe clause.:rows-inCount of rows into the clause.:rows-outCount of rows out of the clause. A large expansion here could be an indicator of poor selectivity.:binds-inVariables that are bound coming into the clause. Insufficiently bound clauses can be less selective.:binds-outVariables that are bound going out of the clause.:predsOptional. Collection of predicate clauses that were used during this clause.:expansionOptional. Difference between :rows-out and :rows-in. Present on top 3 clauses with the biggest difference. This may or may not indicate a problem â€“ sometimes a large expansion is part of what the query needs to accomplish.:warningsOptional. Map of possible concerns. See [:warnings](#warnings)



`:warnings`
-----------

KeyDescription:unbound-varsPresent when none of the vars needed for the clause were bound. This will almost always cause poor performance.
