Programming with Data and EDN
=============================

Datomic is designed to be directly programmable using data. That means your application's code can use ordinary data structures to communicate with Datomic. [Extensible Data Notation](http://edn-format.org) (EDN) is a way of representing these data structures as text. Example transactions, queries, query results, and sample data throughout this Developer Guide are presented in EDN. You can also construct the necessary data structures programmatically using any of the languages supported by Datomic.

This section explains how to read EDN notation and how to use data structures to program with Datomic. Even if you don't use EDN in your application's code, you'll want to be able to read EDN so that you can understand the examples in this Developer Guide.

A 70 second overview of EDN can be found at the [EDN Live Tutorial](../livetutorial/edntutorial.html).

A video is available [on Youtube](https://youtu.be/5eKgRcvEJxU) as well.





Datomic Data Types
------------------

The sections below summarize the data types used by Datomic, and explain the EDN notation used to represent each type.

Following EDN convention, the examples in this Developer Guide use whitespace instead of commas to separate elements in collections. You may use commas to separate elements in collections if you wish; they will be ignored by the reader. EDN treat commas as whitespace unless they appear inside a string.

For more detailed information, refer to the [EDN specification](http://edn-format.org).



### Scalar Data Types for Numbers

Datomic uses the following data types to store numbers:

- **long** - A fixed, signed integer in [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%2527s_complement) binary representation. Has the same semantics as a Java `long`.
- **bigint** - An arbitrary precision signed integer. Same as [`java.math.BigInteger`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html) on Java platforms.
- **double** - A double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number. Corresponds to a Java `double`.
- **float** - A single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point number. Corresponds to a Java `float`.
- **bigdec** - A floating point number with arbitrary and exact precision. Corresponds to [`java.math.BigDecimal`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html).

### Other Scalar Data Types

Datomic uses the following non-numeric scalar data types (syntax indicated in table below):

- **string** - a string.
- **character** - a single character.
- **boolean** - a boolean.
- **instant** - An instant in time (not a date).
- **uuid** - A universally unique identifier. Corresponds to `java.util.UUID`.
- **symbol** - Symbols are used to represent identifiers, similar to programming language keywords and variable names. Symbols may include an optional namespace in the form `namespace/name`.
- **keyword** - Keywords are identifiers that typically designate themselves, similar to programming language enumerations. Keywords follow the rules of symbols, except they must begin with a colon (:). May include an optional namespace in the form `:namespace/name`.

Having dedicated non-string types for symbols and keywords makes EDN especially suitable for DSLs while retaining its all-data nature, and that is leveraged by Datomic for query and transaction syntax.

See [EDN specification](http://edn-format.org) for keyword chars.`:find`, `:where`, `:db/id`, `:db/doc`, `:namespace/foo`



### Collection Data Types

Datomic uses the following data types for multi-valued collections:

- **list** - A list is a sequence of values. Lists are represented by zero or more elements enclosed in parentheses (). Lists may contain heterogeneous elements and scalar or nested values. The use of lists instead of vectors in Datomic syntax is optional, and is often done just to distinguish different constructs.
- **vector** - A vector is a sequence of values. Vectors are represented by zero or more elements enclosed in square brackets \[\]. Vectors may contain heterogeneous elements, and simple or nested values.
- **map** - A map is a collection of associations between keys and values. Maps are represented by a set of zero or more key/value pairs, entirely enclosed in curly braces {}. Keys and values can be elements of any type. Maps may contain heterogeneous elements, and simple or nested values.

Query EDN Example
-----------------

Below is an example of a query shown in EDN. This query finds the IDs of all entities with a `:community/name` attribute whose value is "belltown".

```clojure
[:find ?c :where [?c :community/name "belltown"]]
```



In the example above:

- `:find` and `:where` are keywords denoting programmatic clauses in the query
- `?c` is a symbol denoting a logic variable
- `:community/name` is a namespaced keyword, used as a constant in the query, and denoting the ident &lt;att-ref-ident&gt; of a particular schema attribute
- "belltown" is a string, used as a constant in the query, and denoting the desired value of the `:community/name` attribute
- the entire query is a vector containing a nested vector

See [the query reference](../query/query-data-reference.html) for more information about query syntax.





Transaction EDN Example
-----------------------

Below is an example of a transaction written in EDN notation. This transaction creates a new entity with two attributes: `:person/name` and `:person/email`.

```clojure
[{:person/name "Anna" :person/email "anna@example.com"}]
```



In the transaction above:

- `:person/name` and `:person/email` are namespaced keywords denoting the idents &lt;att-ref-ident&gt; of attributes the new entity will possess
- "Anna" is a string denoting the the value of the `:person/name`attribute
- "anna@example.com" is string denoting the value of the `:person/email` attribute
- the entire transaction is a vector containing a nested map

See [transaction structure](../transactions/transaction-data-reference.html) for more information about how transactions are structured.
