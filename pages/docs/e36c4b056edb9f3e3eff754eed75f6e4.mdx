Configuration
=============

Datomic analytics is implemented via a Datomic connector to [Trino](https://trino.io/blog/2020/12/27/announcing-trino.html). To begin using analytics, you will need to perform the following steps:

Each of these steps is explained below, along with pointers for deploying analytics [for production use](#production).

Prerequisites
-------------

- An accessible [Datomic Cloud System](../getting-started/start-system.html)
- Java 11





Install Datomic Analytics
-------------------------

[Download (1.17GB)](https://downloads.datomic.com/builds/datomic-presto-server/datomic-presto-server-96.zip) and unzip the latest version (0.9.96) of the Datomic Presto Server. This zip file includes the PrestoSQL distribution (now named Trino, and referred to Trino from here on), the Datomic connector, and example configuration files for getting started.





Configure a Trino Cluster
-------------------------

Trino configuration lives under a directory that Trino commands call the `etc-dir`. The `etc-dir` is specified when [launching trino](#start).

The `etc-samples` directory of Datomic analytics is part of the Trino `etc-dir` configured to run a minimal Trino cluster of a single node on your local machine. You can leave these configuration files unchanged while exploring Trino on your local machine, and consult the [Trino docs](https://trino.io/docs/current/) when you are ready to plan a production cluster.





Configure Connections
---------------------

For each Datomic system, you will create a Trino [catalog](https://trino.io/docs/current/overview/concepts.html#catalog) property file in the `catalog` subdirectory of the Trino [etc-dir](#trino-cluster). A catalog file has a name of the form `<catalog>.properties`, where `<catalog>` is the catalog name. `/etc-samples/catalog` in the provided zip has an example catalog properties.

A Datomic catalog property file has the following entries:

propertyrequired?valueNotesconnector.nameyes"datomic"Do not change.datomic.client.configyesa Datomic [client connect map](../client/client-api.html#client)Must be on one line.datomic.databasesnoa vector of Datomic database names The `datomic.databases` property lists the databases that will be available via Trino. Supplying one or more databases enables [JDBC Metadata](#jdbc-metadata). If this property is omitted, all databases will be available and not automatically queried.

Any time you change a catalog file, you will need to stop and then start the Trino cluster for your changes to take effect.

The `etc-samples` directory includes a catalog named `sample.properties`. Before you start Trino, edit this file and set `datomic.client.config` to have a valid [client connect map](../client/client-api.html#client) for your system.

You can also rename the file from `sample.properties` to something more descriptive of your system.



### Enabling JDBC Metadata

Many analytics tools provide the ability to automatically explore all of the tables in your system. Such exploration involves issuing one (or many!) JDBC metadata queries, forcing each database in your system to be loaded.

Because these automatic queries can be so expensive, they are disabled by default. To enable JDBC metadata queries, you must explicitly enumerate the Datomic databases you want to query with the `datomic.databases` property [described above](#connections).







Configure Metaschema
--------------------

Metaschema files control the mapping between Datomic attributes and SQL tables and columns. Metaschema files are `.edn` files in the `datomic` subdirectory of Trino's `etc-dir`. Metaschema files can have any name you find convenient, and Datomic analytics will automatically associate metaschemas with any database that has matching attributes.

The `etc-samples` directory includes a metaschema file matching the [mbrainz database](https://github.com/Datomic/mbrainz-importer).

To facilitate interactive development, Datomic analytics automatically discovers changes to metaschema files within a minute of changes. You do *not* need to restart your Trino cluster to pick up changes to metaschema files. However, if you use an analytics tool such as metabase that scans Trino to discover schema, you may need to re-run the scan manually to pick up metaschema changes.





Start and Stop Trino
--------------------

Datomic analytics can be launched with Trino's `bin/launcher`command.

First make scripts executable:

```example
chmod +x bin/launcher*
```



To run analytics in the foreground of a shell window, navigate to the root directory of the Datomic analytics bundle and enter:

```example
bin/launcher run --etc-dir=etc-samples
```



To verify that your Trino cluster is running, go to [localhost:8989](http://localhost:8989), enter use the username `admin` and leave the password field blank. A Cluster Overview should be displayed with metrics about your cluster.

To stop Trino, you can simply interrupt or kill the process, e.g. with Ctrl-C.





Trino in Production
-------------------

The sample configuration that ships with Datomic anlaytics will have you up and quering in minutes, but it only scratches the surface of things you may want to do. Trino also allows you to join across disparate data sources, and cluster for horizontal scale.

When you are ready to run Trino in production, you will want to

- [tune your JVM config](https://trino.io/docs/current/installation/deployment.html?=catalog#jvm-config) to take full advantage of available memory
- run Trino [as a daemon](https://trino.io/docs/current/installation/deployment.html?=catalog#running-trino) or in a container
- [configure authn/authz](https://trino.io/docs/current/security/overview.html)

All of these options and more are covered in the [Trino deployment docs](https://trino.io/docs/current/overview.html).

Now you can [use the SQL CLIent](analytics-cli.html).
