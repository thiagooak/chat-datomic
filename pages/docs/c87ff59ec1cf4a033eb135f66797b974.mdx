    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: :db.error/invalid-install-attribute at datomic.error-arg.invoke(error.clj:55) at datomic.db-install\_attribute\_hook.invoke(db.clj:1034) at datomic.db-run\_hooks-fn\_\_3689.invoke(db.clj:1849)
    
    then you may have incorrectly retracted a schema entity. Contact support@cognitect.com for assistance recovering from this error.
- Protection against placing non-schema entities in the `:db.part/db` partition. If you see the following error message
    
    "Only schema components can be installed in partition :db.part/db"
    
    you will need to correct your program to create non-schema entities in `:db.part/user` or a partition you create.
- Fixed bug that prevented compilation of some `:require` forms in data functions.

All users of adaptive indexing (0.9.4699 or greater) are strongly encouraged to upgrade to this release. Both transactors and peers need to be upgraded, but it's not necessary to upgrade them simultaneously.





Changed in 0.9.4724
-------------------

This release upgrades the backup format to improve backup capacity against large databases. Datomic now stores backups using a subdirectory structure.

0.9.4724 is able to restore backups taken by previous versions of Datomic. However, previous versions of Datomic will not be able to restore newer backups.





Changed in 0.9.4718

---

0.9.4532 includes an upgrade to the log format that requires simultaneous update of peers and transactors, and is not compatible with older versions, see below:





Changed in 0.9.4532
-------------------

This release upgrades the database log to format version 2.

- All peers and transactors in a system must move together to this version or later.
- The transactor and peers are backwards compatible with log version 1 Transactors will automatically upgrade database logs to version 2 when a database is used. The performance cost of this upgrade is negligible and upgrades can be performed against production systems.
- Older versions of the peer and transactor are -not- forward compatible with log version 2, and will report the following error:
    
    NullPointerException java.util.UUID.fromString
- Downgrading to log version 1 is possible. This release includes a command line tool that can be used to downgrade a database to log version 1:
    
    bin/datomic revert-to-log-version-1 {your-database-uri}
- Fixed bug where, after a transactor failure, Datomic processes could fail to start with a "Gap in data" exception.

-------------------

- New Feature: [Alter Schema](https://blog.datomic.com/2014/01/schema-alteration.html).

This feature breaks compatibility with older versions. Once a schema alteration has been performed on a database, only connect peers and transactors running at least version 0.9.4470 to that database.

- New API: Database.[attribute](javadoc/datomic/Database.html#attribute-java.lang.Object-)and [Attribute](javadoc/datomic/Attribute.html)
- New APIs: [Connection.syncIndex / syncSchema / syncExcise.](javadoc/datomic/Connection.html).

Changed in 0.9.4314
-------------------

- IAM roles are now the preferred way to supply credentials when running Datomic in AWS. See [Storage](overview/storage.html) to configure a new htransactor using IAM roles. See [migrate-to-roles](operation/migrate-to-roles.html) to migrate an hexisting Datomic configuration to use IAM roles.
- The transactor now supports a mechanism for integrating different monitoring services, see the 'Custom Monitoring' section of [monitoring](operation/monitoring.html)

Changed in 0.8.4215
-------------------

- Improved redundacy elimination. If a transaction presents a datom that is identical (except for tx) to an existing datom, that datom will not be added to the log.





Changed in 0.8.4159
-------------------

- Updated aws-java-sdk dependency to 1.5.5, discontinued using jets3t.
- Reduced background thread usage in query.
- Transactions now convert doubles to floats when attribute schema requires floats.

- Eliminate spurious file bin/logback-test.xml that was incorrectly included in 0.8.4111.





Changed in 0.8.4111
-------------------

- New: Memory settings for the transactor must be explicitly specified in the transactor properties file. There are no default settings, so existing transactor property files that lack these settings will no longer work. The transactor properties sample files include three complete examples, representing ongoing usage, one-time imports, and constrained-memory usage during development.
- New: Stricter validation of datoms within a single transaction, preventing duplication of the same datom and multiple assertions of cardinality-one attributes. This will cause transactions that would formerly have succeeded to fail with a validation error.
- New: The transactor and peer now require Clojure 1.5.1 or greater.
- New: Peer configuration setting for peer/transactor connection timeout. Specify system property `datomic.peerConnectionTTLMsec` in milliseconds. Default and minimum are both 10000.

transactor is unavailable.

- Improved peer recovery time during [HA](operation/ha.html) failover.





Changed in 0.8.3971
-------------------

- Fixed bug where some active log segments are marked as garbage, which can result in log corruption after a call to `gcStorage`. Moving to this release is strongly advised.
- Improved CloudWatch metric: `IndexWrites` is now reported once per indexing job, making it easier to reason about per-index-job load.
- New CloudWatch metric: `TransactionBatch` tracks the number of transactions batched into a single write to the log.

-------------------

(Do not use this release.)





Changed in 0.8.3960
-------------------

- Fixed bug where indexing jobs could fail for fulltext attributes.





Changed in 0.8.3952
-------------------

0.8.3705 is a breaking change to peer/transactor communication !!
-----------------------------------------------------------------





Changed in 0.8.3705
-------------------

- Upgrade to HornetQ 2.2.21. This change breaks compatibility with older versions, so peers and transactors must be upgraded together.





Changed in 0.8.3704
-------------------

- Fixed bug in HA support. HA does not work with the three previous releases (3692, 3664, 3655). If you are running a standby transactor for HA, make sure to upgrade to this release.





Changed in 0.8.3692
-------------------

- Fixed bug where restore would restore to a version other than the most recent in the backup storage.
- Improved backup CLI: You can now `list-backups` to see different points in time (t) that are backed up to a storage, and pass a `t` argument to `restore-db` to restore from a version other than the most recent in the backup storage.
- Fixed bug: all transaction errors now throw exceptions consistent with the API documentation. (Some errors had been throwing early, on transact, rather than on dereferencing the transaction future.)
- Fixed bug where a portion of the history index was not considered by the `asOf` database filter.
- Fixed bug where, under unusual circumstances, datoms could reappear in the present index, even though they had been retracted.
- Performance optimization: Peer cache now reads ahead on indexes.
- Updated to spymemcached 2.8.9.
- Fixed bug where retraction of a nonexistent fulltext attribute value could cause subsequent indexing jobs to fail.
- Fixed bug that could prevent connection to a database after a cycle of create / backup / delete / restore.





Changed in 0.8.3664
-------------------

- Added gap-detection validation when reading log on startup.
    
    Operating with a gap, while not resulting in loss of data, can cause violations of uniqueness and cardinality constraints. Users on releases prior to 0.8.3664 are strongly encouraged to move to 0.8.3664 or later as soon as possible.





Changed in 0.8.3655
-------------------

- Fixed bug where entities could have more than one :db/fn attribute.
- Fixed bug in log loading where a window of data could be invisible on restart, even though that data is present in the log.





Changed in 0.8.3646
-------------------

- Fixed bug where database indexing fails after a backup/restore cycle.
- Fixed bug in Clojure API where transaction futures sometimes would return (rather than throw) an exception.
- Fixed bug in Java API where transaction futures would occasionally return an object that is not the documented map.

Changed in 0.8.3627
-------------------

- Fixed bug where first restore of a database to a new storage did not include the most recent data, even though that data was present in the backup. (Subsequent restores were unaffected).
- Queries now take a :with clause, to specify variables to be kept in the aggregation set but not returned.
- Database.filter predicates now take two arguments: the unfiltered Database value and the Datom.
- You can now retrieve the Database that is the basis of an entity with Entity.db.
- You can now install a release of Datomic Pro into your local maven repository with bin/maven-install.





Changed in 0.8.3619
-------------------

- Alpha release of Database.filter, which returns a value of the database filtered to contain only the datoms satisfying a predicate.
- New AWS metric: IndexWrites.
- Peers no longer need to include a Datomic-specific maven repository, as Fressian (<https://github.com/Datomic/fressian>) is now available from Maven Central and clojars.





Changed in 0.8.3611

Changed in 0.8.3595
-------------------

- Fixed bug that prevented building queries from Java data.
- Transactor AMIs are now available in all AWS regions that support DynamoDB: us-east-1, us-west-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1, ap-northeast-1. and ap-southeast-1.
- Breaking change: CloudFormation properties file has a new required key `aws-region`, allowing you to select the AWS region where a transactor will run.





Changed in 0.8.3591
-------------------

- Preliminary support for Couchbase and Riak storages.
- Breaking change: DynamoDB storage is now region-aware. URIs include the AWS region as a first component. The transactor properties file has a new mandatory property `aws-dynamodb-region`.
- Breaking change: CloudWatch monitoring is now region-aware. If using CloudWatch, you must set `aws-cloudwatch-region` in transactor properties.
- Transactions now return a datomic.ListenableFuture, allowing a callback on transaction completion.
- Fixed bug in the command line entry point for restoring a database, which was defaulting to the most ancient backup instead of thre most recent.
- Fixed bug that prevented restoring to a `dev:` or `free:` storage in some situations.





Changed in 0.8.3561
-------------------

- Breaking change: db.with() now returns a map like the map returned from Connection.transact().
- Incompatible and unsupported schema changes now throw exceptions.
- Better error messages when calling query with bad or missing inputs.
- Documented system properties.





Changes in 0.8.3551
-------------------

- Fixes to alpha aggregation functions.





Changes in 0.8.3546
-------------------

- Alpha support for aggregation functions in query.





Changes in 0.8.3538
-------------------

- Fixed bug where variables bound by a query :in clause were not seen as bound inside rules.
- Added `invoke` API for invoking database functions.





Changes in 0.8.3524
-------------------

Changes in 0.8.3520
-------------------

- Fixed but that prevented catalog page from loading on REST service when running against a persistent storage.
- Enhancements to REST documentation.





Changes in 0.8.3511
-------------------

- The REST service is now its own documentation. Just point a browser at the root of the server:port on which you started the service. Note that the "web app" that results **is** the service. It is not an app built on the service, nor a set of documentation pages about the service. The URIs, query params, and POST data are the same ones you will use when accessing the service programmatically.





Changes in 0.8.3488
-------------------

- Initial version of REST service.





Changes in 0.8.3479
-------------------

- new API: `Entity.touch` touches all attributes of an entity, and any component entities recursively.





Changes in 0.8.3470
-------------------

- Fixed bug where some recursive queries return incorrect results.
- Fixed bug in command-line entry point for restoring from S3.





Changes in 0.8.3460
-------------------

- Fixed bug where peers could continue to interact with connections to deleted databases.
- Fixed query bug where constants in queries were not correctly joined with answers.
- Fixed directory structure in JAR file format, which was causing problems for some tools.

Changes in 0.8.3438
-------------------

- Fixed bug in :db/txInstant that prevented backdating before db was created.





Changes in 0.8.3435
-------------------

- new API: `Peer.resolveTempid` provides the actual database ids corresponding to temporary ids submitted in a transaction.
- changed API: You can now explicitly specify the :db/txInstant of a transaction. This facilitates backdating transactions during data imports.
- changed API: Transaction futures now return a map with DB\_BEFORE, DB\_AFTER, TX\_DATA and TEMPIDS.
- changed API: Transaction report queues now report the same data as calls to `Connection.transact`
- changed API: Transaction report TX\_DATA now includes retractions in addition to assertions.
- new API: `Database.basisT` returns the t of the most recent transaction
- Bugfix: fixed bug that prevented AWS provisioning scripts from running





Changes in 0.8.3423
-------------------

- new API: `Database.history` returns a value of a database containing all assertions and retractions across time
- new API: `Database.isHistory` returns true if database is a history database
- new API: `Datom.added` returns true if datom is added, false if retracted
- changed API: the Datom relation in a query now exposes a fifth component, containing a boolean that is true for adds, false for retracts
- changed API: removed `Index` class, range capability now available directly from `Database`

- improved fulltext indexing and query performance





Changes in 0.8.3372
-------------------

- changed API: query clauses are considered in order
- changed API: when navigating entities, references to entities that have a `db/ident` return that ident, instead of the entity
- new API: `Database.index` supports range requests
- fixed broken dependency that prevented datomic-pro peer jar from working with DynamoDB
- new API: `Peer.part` function returns the partition of an entity id
- new API: `Peer.toTx` and `Peer.toT` conversion functions
- entity equality is ref-like, i.e. identity-based
- eliminated resource leaks that affected multiple databases and some failover scenarios





Changes in 0.8.3343
-------------------

- added API entry points for generating semi-sequential UUIDs, a.k.a squuids
- use correct maven artifact ids: `datomic-free` for Datomic Free Edition, and `datomic-pro` for Datomic Pro Edition
