Read Revisited
==============

First, don't forget to acquire the latest value of the database, **after** the transaction that added the order.

noslide

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">db</span> (d/db conn))
```



Parameterized Query
-------------------

Now let's try a more complex query. We would like to be able to suggest additional items to shoppers, so we need a query that, given any inventory item, finds all the other items that have ever appeared in the same order.

Such a query will have two parameters:

- a database value
- an inventory entity id

Parameters enter query via additional arguments to `q`, and they are named by a corresponding *:in* clause. The special *$* name is a placeholder for the database value.

noslide

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?sku
       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:in</span> $ ?inv
       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span> [?item <span style="color: #008b8b;">:item/id</span> ?inv]
              [?order <span style="color: #008b8b;">:order/items</span> ?item]
              [?order <span style="color: #008b8b;">:order/items</span> ?other-item]
              [?other-item <span style="color: #008b8b;">:item/id</span> ?other-inv]
              [?other-inv <span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/sku</span> ?sku]]
     db [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/sku</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-25"</span>])
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> [[<span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-25"</span>] [<span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-26"</span>]]
```



Notice how variables are used to join:

- *?inv* is bound on input to the entity id for *SKU-25*, which
- joins to every order *?item* mentioning *?inv*, which
- joins to every *?order* of that *?item*, which
- joins to every *?other-item* in those orders, which
- joins to every *?other-inv* inventory entity, which
- joins to all the skus *?sku*





Rules
-----

The "related items" feature is so nice that we would like to use it in a bunch of different queries. You can name query logic as a rule and reuse it in multiple queries.

Create a rule named *ordered-together* that binds two variables *?inv*and *?other-inv* if they have ever appeared in the same order:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">rules</span>
  '[[(ordered-together ?inv ?other-inv)
     [?item <span style="color: #008b8b;">:item/id</span> ?inv]
     [?order <span style="color: #008b8b;">:order/items</span> ?item]
     [?order <span style="color: #008b8b;">:order/items</span> ?other-item]
     [?other-item <span style="color: #008b8b;">:item/id</span> ?other-inv]]])
```



Now you can pass these *rules* to a query, using the special *:in* name *%*, and then refer to the rules by name:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?sku
       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:in</span> $ % ?inv
       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span> (ordered-together ?inv ?other-inv)
              [?other-inv <span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/sku</span> ?sku]]
     db rules [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/sku</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-25"</span>])
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> [[<span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-25"</span>] [<span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-26"</span>]]
```



So far we have created an accumulated data. Now let's look at what happens when [things change over time](retract.html).
