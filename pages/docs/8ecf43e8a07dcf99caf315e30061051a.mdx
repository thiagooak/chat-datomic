Using Metabase
==============

[Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) is an open-source interactive data analytics, visualization, and business intelligence tool. You can configure Metabase to use Datomic as a data source via the included "presto" connector.

Installing
----------

- Download Metabase from the [Metabase Start Page](https://www.metabase.com/start/), via the `Custom Install - metabase.jar` method
- Start Metabase with:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">java -jar metabase.jar
```



- Point your browser to `localhost:3000`.
- Select "Let's get started".
- Fill out "What should we call you".
- Select "I'll add my data later"
- Select your preferred Usage data preferences.





Configuring Metabase for Datomic Analytics
------------------------------------------

In the Metabase window, browse to:

Settings → Admin → Databases → Add Database

Configure the connection to Datomic Analytics:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">Database Type: Presto
Name: <give-it-a-name>
Host: <host>
Port: <port>
Database Name: <catalog>
Database Username: <user>
Database Password: <password>
```



Substituting appropriate values for `name`, `host`, `port`, `user`, `password` and `catalog`

`port` is 8989 by default.

The `user` and `password` are your trino server password, which default to `admin` and no password by default.

`catalog` is the [catalog](analytics-configuring.html#connections) that you configured when setting up Datomic Analytics.
