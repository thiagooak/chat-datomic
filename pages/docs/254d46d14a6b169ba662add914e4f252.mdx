### Clients in Control

David Nolen talks about how Datomic and Om worsk together at Datomic Conf 2015.

- [Riak Community Hangout 6 - Datomic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD9UCfQohQE) Stuart Halloway discusses Datomic at a Riak Community Hangout.
- [Using Datomic with Riak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOQVWdG5e2s) Rich Hickey at RICON East 2013.
- [Datomic by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iaIwiemqfo) Rich Hickey presents Datomic at Hakka Labs.
- [Datomic, and How We Built It](https://vimeo.com/79432448) Stuart Halloway tells how Datomic was designed and built at SCNA.
- [The Functional Database](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/datomic-functional-database/) Rich Hickey discusses how a functional database can impact the programming model, using Datomic as an example, but the principles apply to other systems using an immutable database.
- [Simulation Testing with Simulant](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simulation-Testing/) Stuart Halloway discusses simulation-based testing using Simulant, a testing library built using Datomic.
- [Deconstructing the Database](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Deconstructing-Database/) Rich Hickey deconstructs the monolithic database into separate services, transactions, storage, query, combining them with a data model based on atomic facts to provide new capabilities and tradeoffs.
- [Rich Hickey on Datomic, CAP, and ACID](https://www.infoq.com/interviews/hickey-datomic-cap/) QCon SF 2012 interview with Rich Hickey.
- [Breaking Down Big Data with Datomic](https://vimeo.com/57428515) Stuart Sierra speaking at Chariot Solutions.
- [Exploring Datomic](https://vimeo.com/53162418) Tim Ewald explores Datomic's architecture and some of its implications, focused entirely on technical details.
- [Writing Datomic in Clojure](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Datomic/) Rich Hickey introduces Datomic, including architectural and implementation details.
- [The Impedance Mismatch is Our Fault](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Impedance-Mismatch/) Stuart Halloway explains what the impedance mismatch is and what can be done to solve it in the context of RDBMS, OOP, and NoSQL.
- [The Database as a Value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdV1IgAaFc) Rich speaking at GOTO Chicago Functional Programming Night. Discusses the importance of immutability and time in representing information, the reification of process, and the mechanisms of durable persistent data structures
