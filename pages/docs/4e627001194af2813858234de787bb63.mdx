Peer Getting Started
====================

A 5 minute guide that explores the most common operations of a database using the peer library:

- [Connecting to a Database](#connecting)
- [Transacting Schema](#transacting-schema)
- [Transacting Data](#transacting)
- [Querying the Data](#querying-data)
- [Seeing Historic Values of Datomic Data](#history)

In order to follow this tutorial you will need Datomic Pro or Datomic Starter. See [Get Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/get-datomic.html) for more details.

Connecting to a Database
------------------------

This tutorial requires Datomic Starter or Datomic Pro. If you do not yet have Datomic, please visit [Get Datomic](https://www.datomic.com/get-datomic.html) to register and download Datomic Starter.

Throughout this tutorial, shell commands are run from the root directory of the Datomic distribution. This will be the version- and edition-qualified directory name. For example:

```
<pre class="example" id="org5cee0c7">
cd /home/user/datomic/datomic-pro-1.0.6644
```

The **bin** directory contains executable scripts for launching a REPL, installing the peer library locally, running a transactor, etc. It also contains storage configuration scripts.

For this example, we will use a local in-memory database, which does not require a transactor to run. For steps on running a transactor please see [Running a dev transactor](../getting-started/dev-setup.html#run-dev-transactor).

To begin, launch a REPL from the root of the Datomic folder using the *bin/repl* script:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">bin/repl
```



The first thing you have to do is load the Peer library:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a0522d;">require</span> '[datomic.api <span style="color: #008b8b;">:as</span> d])
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> nil
```



Next, create the URI that allows you to create and connect to a database. For this tutorial, the URI will have three parts:

- "datomic", identifying it as a Datomic URI
- "mem", the mem storage protocol that uses local memory instead of a persistent store
- "hello", the name of the database

Bind a var, *db-uri*, to the value of the URI:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">db-uri</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"datomic:mem://hello"</span>)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #'user/db-uri
```



Next, create the "hello" database using the *create-database* function.

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/create-database db-uri)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> true
```



To interact with Datomic, you must first create a connection.

To create a connection with the Peer library, pass the URI to the *connect* function and bind the returned connection value to a var called *"conn"*:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">conn</span> (d/connect db-uri))
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #'user/conn
```



You should see that a var was created called *"conn"* which is holding your database connection. You can inspect it:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">conn
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #object[<span style="color: #483d8b;">datomic.peer.LocalConnection</span> 0x6ca372ef <span style="color: #8b2252;">"datomic.peer.LocalConnection@6ca372ef"</span>]
```



You can now use "*conn*" as an input to future commands.

The next step will be to define some schema for your new database.





Transacting schema
------------------

Previously: you learned [how to connect to a database](#connecting) This section expects that you have a running REPL where you have already created and connected to the database "hello".

One of the great things about Datomic is that everything is data, including the definition of the schema for your database. Because it is just data, it can be created and manipulated just like any other data you put into the database. To add new schema, you issue a transaction that carries the new schema definition.

We'll create a basic model for movies: a movie can have a title, a release year, and a genre. Title and genre are represented as strings, while release year is an integer. In a relational database, each of those (title, release year, and genre) would be considered "fields" in a "table".

In Datomic, each of those is an attribute, which can be associated with an entity. To start adding movie data to our database, we'll have to tell it about those three attributes.

Since schema is just data, you describe your custom attributes using Datomic's built-in attributes.

Every attribute definition has three required attributes:

- `:db/ident` which specifies a unique name for your attribute
- `:db/valueType` which specifies the type of data that can be stored in the attribute
- `:db/cardinality` which specifies whether the attribute stores a single value or many values

You should also supply the optional `:db/doc` attribute, which stores a docstring of the attribute which you can query for later.

Attribute definitions are defined as maps of data. Our first attribute, "title", would be defined as:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/valueType</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.type/string</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/cardinality</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.cardinality/one</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/doc</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The title of the movie"</span>}
```



> (Note that :db.type/string and :db.cardinality/one are examples of built-in attributes, used for the purpose of defining attributes. You can learn more about them in the [reference guide](../schema/schema.html).)

Similarly, "genre" would be:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/genre</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/valueType</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.type/string</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/cardinality</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.cardinality/one</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/doc</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The genre of the movie"</span>}
```



Since "year" will be stored as a number, we'll have to change the :db.type for it:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/release-year</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/valueType</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.type/long</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/cardinality</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.cardinality/one</span>
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/doc</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The year the movie was released in theaters"</span>}
```



You could choose to send each of these attributes to the database in individual transactions, but for efficiency, we'll batch them up into a single transaction. To do that, you combine the three maps into a single vector of maps. Let's bind our schema vector to a var called *movie-schema*:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">movie-schema</span> [{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/valueType</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.type/string</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/cardinality</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.cardinality/one</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/doc</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The title of the movie"</span>}

                   {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/genre</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/valueType</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.type/string</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/cardinality</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.cardinality/one</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/doc</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The genre of the movie"</span>}

                   {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/release-year</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/valueType</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.type/long</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/cardinality</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.cardinality/one</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/doc</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The year the movie was released in theaters"</span>}])
```



Now that we have our attribute definitions ready to go, we have to issue a transaction via the Peer library, using the *transact* function. Transact takes two arguments:

- an active connection
- a collection of transaction data, formatted in [List or Map form.](../transactions/transactions.html#list-forms)

Go ahead and transact the schema:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">@(d/transact conn movie-schema)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=>
  {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db-before</span> datomic.db.Db@624b73ed, <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db-after</span> datomic.db.Db@f0d17d2a,
   <span style="color: #008b8b;">:tx-data</span>
    [#datom[13194139534312 50 #inst <span style="color: #8b2252;">"2017-02-16T16:24:50.487-00:00"</span> 13194139534312 true]

     #datom[0 13 64 13194139534312 true]
     #datom[0 13 63 13194139534312 true]],

```



The presence of the *:db-before* and a *:db-after* values shows you that new information was transmitted and persisted in your database. You can learn more about the details of this return value by reading the details of [transact](../clojure/index.html#datomic.api/transact) in the reference guide.

Next, we'll start adding movies into the database.





Transacting Data
----------------

Previously: you learned [how to transact schema into the database](#transacting-schema). This tutorial expects that you have a running REPL where you have already connected to the database "hello" and transacted the movie schema.

As was mentioned previously, schema is just data, like any other data. So you will be unsurprised to learn that creating domain data is a very similar operation to the creation and transaction of schema.

Once again, you will take advantage of the *transact* method of the Peer library, which takes an active connection and a list of transaction data. First, define your data. First, define your data, again storing it in a var first:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">first-movies</span> [{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The Goonies"</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/genre</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/release-year</span> 1985}
                   {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/genre</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/release-year</span> 1985}
                   {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Repo Man"</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/genre</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"punk dystopia"</span>
                    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/release-year</span> 1984}])
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #'user/first-movies
```



This is an example of the power of working directly with data – anything you might do to assemble a map of movie data could be substituted for the var first-movies. You can also pass that map to intermediate functions for cleaning/pre-processing before transacting.

Now that you have the movies ready to go, transact them into the database:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">@(d/transact conn first-movies)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=>
{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db-before</span> datomic.db.Db@f0d17d2a, <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db-after</span> datomic.db.Db@6bc4da95,
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:tx-data</span> 
   [#datom[13194139534313 50 #inst <span style="color: #8b2252;">"2017-02-16T16:27:03.660-00:00"</span> 13194139534313 true] 
    #datom[17592186045418 63 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The Goonies"</span> 13194139534313 true] 
    #datom[17592186045418 64 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span> 13194139534313 true] 
    #datom[17592186045418 65 1985 13194139534313 true] 
    #datom[17592186045419 63 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span> 13194139534313 true] 
    #datom[17592186045419 64 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span> 13194139534313 true] 
    #datom[17592186045419 65 1985 13194139534313 true] 
    #datom[17592186045420 63 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Repo Man"</span> 13194139534313 true] 
    #datom[17592186045420 64 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"punk dystopia"</span> 13194139534313 true] 
    #datom[17592186045420 65 1984 13194139534313 true]], 
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:tempids</span> {-9223301668109598141 17592186045418,
           -9223301668109598140 17592186045419,
           -9223301668109598139 17592186045420}}
```



Once again, the response you get back contains a *:db-before* and a *:db-after*. You can also see that it clearly lists out all the actual data that was added to the database in the *:tx-data* key.

So, now you have three movies in the database. Next you will learn how to query for them.





Query Data
----------

Previously: you learned [how to transact domain data into the database](#transacting). This section expects that you have a running REPL where you have already connected to the database "hello" and transacted the movie schema and three movies.

Previously, you transacted three sets of attributes into the database, creating three movies. What you actually created were three **entities**, each of which has a unique id and a collection of associated attributes. The unique ids were assigned for you when you transacted the data. (For more on entity ids, see [Identity and Uniqueness](../schema/identity.html).) When you query a Datomic database, you may be looking to retrieve attribute values, collections of attribute values, entities, or any combination thereof. The Peer library offers three mechanisms for retrieving data from your database:

- **query** which uses Datalog, a declarative query language
- **pull** which is a declarative way to make hierarchical (and possibly nested) selections of information about entities
- **entity** which allows you, given an entity id, to pull a lazy, associative view of all the information that can be reached from that entity id

We'll focus on query in this tutorial. For more on Pull, read [Datomic Pull](../query/pull.html), and for more on Entity, read [Entities](../overview/entities.html).

First, in order to issue a query against a Datomic database, you must retrieve the current database value. A database value is the state of the database at a given point in time. You can issue as many queries against that database value as you want, they will always run against the database as of the same point in time. Retrieve the current database value and store it in a var:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">db</span> (d/db conn))
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #'user/db
```



Once you have the database value, you can issue queries against it. You issues queries via the *q* function. *q* takes two required parameters:

- query data (represented as a map or list) containing **at least** a *:find* clause and a *:where* clause
- a list of input sources for the query

The query data can also contain a variety of other optional components, which you can learn more about in the [q Reference](../clojure/index.html#datomic.api/q).

When you craft your Datalog query, you must provide enough of a *:where* clause to limit the results. So the question is, how do we ask for all the movies in our database? In our schema, a movie is anything that has an associated *:movie/title* attribute (or *:movie/release-year* or *:movie/genre*, but we'll just use *:movie/title* for now).

For this tutorial, you will use the list form of the query data. To construct your query, you must create a vector with the three mandatory components listed above. Let's look at a minimal query:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">all-movies-q</span> '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span> [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span>]])
```



Here we define a var (all-movies-q) that holds our query, which we will later pass to the *q* function. Look at the two clauses:

- *:find* – specifies what you want returned from the query. In this case, *?e* is a logic variable that will be bound within the *:where* clause
- *:where* – the *:where* clauses consist of a list of vectors. In our case, we are only passing one clause, *\[?e :movie/title\]*, which translates to "bind the id of each entity that has an attribute called *:movie/title* to the logic variable named *?e*"

So, the whole query reads as "find me the ids of all entities which have an attribute called *:movie/title*".

To actually issue the query, call *q* and pass the query and the database value. You will see something like the following:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q all-movies-q db)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #{[17592186045418] [17592186045419] [17592186045420]}
```



You can see that there were three entities in the database with a *:movie/title*, corresponding to the three movies you added in the last section. What you received back is a collection of return values, each of which in this case is just the entity id.

Once you have entity ids, you can use them to find out other data about the given entity. To learn more about entities, read the [Entities guide](../overview/entities.html).

Instead of finding the entity ids, perhaps you just want to find all the titles of all the movies in the database. In that case, your query would specify a *:find* clause with a named value (*?movie-title*) that you bind to an attribute (*:movie/title*). It looks like this:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">all-titles-q</span> '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?movie-title <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span> [_ <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span> ?movie-title]])
```



Notice the underscore at the beginning of the *:where* clause where *?e* used to be. That indicates that we are not interested in the entity id itself, just the existence (and value of) the *:movie/title* attribute. The query reads "find all movie titles from any entity that has an attribute *:movie/title* and assign the title to a logic variable called *?movie-title*".

To execute the query, pass it and the db value in as before:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q all-titles-q db)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #{[<span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span>] [<span style="color: #8b2252;">"The Goonies"</span>] [<span style="color: #8b2252;">"Repo Man"</span>]}
```



Great! You were able to query for the attributes from a collection of all the movies in the database. Again, you received a collection of return values, each of which this time is the string title of the movie.

But what if you only want the titles of movies released in 1985? In order to issue that query, your *:where* argument is going to have to have two clauses, one to bind the *:movie/title* attribute (as before), and one to filter by *:movie/release-year*. Those two clauses have to be **joined**.

Remember in the last example, our *:where* clause contained an \_ where we first saw *?e*, because we were not interested in the entity id itself, only the value of the *:movie/title* attribute. Now, we will re-insert *?e* into both clauses, and that will serve as the join point for the two clauses. In Datalog, joins are created implicitly by the presence of the same logic variable in multiples clauses.

The new query looks like this:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">titles-from-1985</span> '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?title <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span> [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span> ?title]
                                            [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/release-year</span> 1985]])
```



That reads: "find the title of any entity that has a *:movie/title* attribute and whose *:movie/release-year* is 1985". When you issue the new query:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q titles-from-1985 db)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #{[<span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span>] [<span style="color: #8b2252;">"The Goonies"</span>]}
```



Finally, what if you want to return all the attributes for each movie released in 1985? You need a clause for each attribute you want to return and for the filter on release year, all of which should be joined through ?e. That query looks like:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">all-data-from-1985</span> '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?e ?title ?year ?genre
                          <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span> [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span> ?title] 
                                 [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/release-year</span> ?year]
                                 [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/genre</span> ?genre]
                                 [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/release-year</span> 1985]])
```



And when you run it:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q all-data-from-1985 db)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=>
#{[17592186045419 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span> 1985 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>]
  [17592186045418 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The Goonies"</span> 1985 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>]}
```



Notice that this time, each of your returned tuples contains multiple values - one per logic variable in the *:find* specification. The shape of the relations returned is defined by your *:find* specification. More information on that can found in the [query reference documention](../query/query.html#find-specifications).

There is much more to learn about Datalog, from nested queries to secondary inputs and more. You can find out about it in the [Query reference](../query/query.html).

In the final section of this tutorial, you will learn about the history of values in the database.





History of Values in the Database
---------------------------------

Previously: you learned [how to query domain data in the database](#querying-data). This tutorial expects that you have a running REPL where you have already connected to the database "hello" and transacted the movie schema and three movies.

You've done all the basics - created, defined and populated a database, and learned how to ask it some questions. Now, we will explore the chronological side of Datomic.

You've created a database with three movies in it. One of them, "Commando", is assigned the "action/adventure" genre. Now, the MPAA has updated its approved list of genres, and added "future governor", for movies starring a future governor. Obviously, Commando needs to be updated.

To change the value of the :movie/genre attribute, you'll first need to find the entity id of Commando:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span> [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span>]] db)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #{[17592186045419]}
```



You should really be binding the found entity id to a local variable so you can use it in your subsequent transactions:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">commando-id</span> (<span style="color: #a0522d;">ffirst</span> (d/q '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span> [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span>]] db)))
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #user/commando-id
```



Next, you need to issue a transaction, telling Datomic about the new value for :movie/genre. Remember back to the "Transacting Data" section that a transaction requires an active connection and a map of transaction data. In this case, we will specify one special new attribute, :db/id, to which we will bind the entity id we just retrieved in the previous query. The transaction looks like this:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">@(d/transact conn [{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/id</span> commando-id <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/genre</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"future governor"</span>}])
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=>
{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db-before</span> datomic.db.Db@6bc4da95, <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db-after</span> datomic.db.Db@ef7748f8,
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:tx-data</span>
  [#datom[13194139534317 50 \#inst <span style="color: #8b2252;">"2017-02-16T16:42:16.787-00:00"</span> 13194139534317 true] 
   #datom[17592186045419 64 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"future governor"</span> 13194139534317 true] 
   #datom[17592186045419 64 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span> 13194139534317 false]], 
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:tempids</span> {}}
```



The transaction succeeded. So, let's go and verify that Commando has been updated.

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q all-data-from-1985 db)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=>
  #{[17592186045419 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span> 1985 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>]
    [17592186045418 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The Goonies"</span> 1985 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>]}
  user=>
```



WAIT? What happened? You saw that your transaction succeeded, but when you asked the database, it still shows "*action/adventure*" for Commando. Is something wrong?

Absolutely not. Remember this from the "Querying the Data" tutorial:

> "A database value is the state of the database at a given point in time. You can issue as many queries against that database value as you want, they will always return the same results."

We issued our transaction against a **connection**, but we are issuing queries against a **database value**, which is a snapshot as of a point in time. And we captured that database value in a var called "db" which we pass into the query as the final argument. It doesn't matter that our transaction succeeded - we aren't seeing the new data because we are querying against the old database value.

So, first, get a current value of the database and then issue your query again:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">db</span> (d/db conn))
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #'user/db
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q all-data-from-1985 db)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=>
#{[17592186045419 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span> 1985 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"future governor"</span>]
  [17592186045418 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The Goonies"</span> 1985 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>]}
```



Great, now we see "Commando" **has** been updated to the latest MPAA specification. What you have seen here is half of the immutability story. As long as you are holding onto a database value and issuing queries against it, you will always see the data as of a single point in time. In order to get see the latest values, you need to update your database value.

But what if you are at the latest value, and want to see where you came from? You have to go and get another version of the database value, at a time before your last transaction. To do this, you have to know the "time basis" of the database value you want. Datomic can use either a transaction id, *t*, or a Date to establish a time basis. Remember the results from issuing the transaction where you transacted the first movies:

```

 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db-after</span> datomic.db.Db@6bc4da95,

  -9223301668109598139 17592186045420}}
```



In the *:tx-data* key, the first list in the data is the attributes associated with the transaction itself. The first number (13194139534313) is the transaction id. In our case, this transaction id represents the time basis we'd like to look at - the one right before our current state, which was created when we updated the genre of "Commando". To grab a different view as of a different time basis, we use the "*as-of*" function, which takes a database value and a time basis:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">old-db</span> (d/as-of db 13194139534313))
```



Now we have a database value from the past, including only changes up until that point in time. Issuing the same query against it, we'll see the value of *:movie/genre* from before our transaction:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q all-data-from-1985 old-db)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=>
#{[17592186045419 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span> 1985 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>]
  [17592186045418 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"The Goonies"</span> 1985 <span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>]}
```



(You can also use "*since*" instead of "*as-of*", which returns a database value with only changes added after a point in time.)

Finally, if you want to see all the values that a given attribute has held over time, you will need to access a special view on the database value, called **history**. To get it, call history on your existing database value:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">hdb</span> (d/history db))
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #'user/hdb
```



Now pass that in to your query instead of db, and voila:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?genre 
       <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span> [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/title</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Commando"</span>]
              [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:movie/genre</span> ?genre]] hdb)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> #{[<span style="color: #8b2252;">"action/adventure"</span>] [<span style="color: #8b2252;">"future governor"</span>]}
```



You can see that the *:movie/genre* attribute of "Commando" has held two different values over time, "*action/adventure*" and "future governor". There is much more you can do with *as-of*, *since*, and *history*, which you can learn more about in [the Filters reference](../time/filters.html).

Congratulations, you've finished a whirlwind tour of using Datomic. For further information, we recommend exploring the [Datomic Client Library](../getting-started/connect-to-a-database.html).
