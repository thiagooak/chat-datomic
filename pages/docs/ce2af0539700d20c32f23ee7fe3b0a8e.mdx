- Start Metabase with:

```

java -jar metabase.jar

Configuring Metabase for Datomic Analytics
------------------------------------------

In the Metabase window, browse to:

Settings → Admin → Databases → Add Database

Configure the connection to Datomic Analytics:

```

Database Type: Presto
Name: <give-it-a-name>
Host: <host>
Port: <port>
Database Name: <catalog>
Database Username: <user>
Database Password: <password>
```

Substituting appropriate values for `name`, `host`, `port`, `user`, `password` and `catalog`

`port` is 8989 by default.

The `user` and `password` are your trino server password, which default to `admin` and no password by default.

`catalog` is the [catalog](analytics-configuring.html#connections) that you configured when setting up Datomic Analytics.
