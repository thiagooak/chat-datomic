Integrating the Client Library
==============================

The Datomic Client library is provided via

[ Maven Central.](https://search.maven.org/search?q=client-pro)It can be integrated in a [Maven project](#maven), [tools.deps](#deps) or [Leiningen project](#leiningen).

Download Client Library
-----------------------

The Datomic Client library is provided via

[ Maven Central.](https://search.maven.org/search?q=client-pro)Create a new Clojure project and add the client library to your dependencies:

> **NOTE**: The Datomic Client requires Clojure version 1.9 or later



### Maven

To retrieve the Client library for a Maven project, add the following snippet inside the &lt;dependencies&gt; block of your pom.xml file:

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.datomic</groupId>
   <artifactId>client-pro</artifactId>
   <version>1.0.76</version
</dependency>
```







### Clojure CLI

To use the Client library from a [Clojure CLI REPL](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli), add the following to your [deps.edn dependencies map](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli):

```clojure
com.datomic/client-pro {:mvn/version "1.0.76"}
```







### Leiningen

Add the following snippet in collection under `:dependencies` key to your [project.clj file](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen):

```clojure
[com.datomic/client-pro "1.0.76"]
```









Start a Clojure REPL
--------------------



### Clojure CLI

Start a REPL with the [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli) in your terminal:

```
<pre class="example" id="orgbcb4d25">
clj
```

Once the REPL is running, you have to import the Client library.

```clojure
(require '[datomic.client.api :as d])
```



You now have a running environment you can use to execute commands against Datomic.





### Leiningen

Start your Leiningen REPL with:

```sh
lein repl
```



Once the REPL is running, you have to import the Client library.

```clojure
(require '[datomic.client.api :as d])
```



You now have a running environment you can use to execute commands against Datomic.
