Setup
=====

There are three steps to set up and connect to Datomic Cloud:

- An AWS account administrator [starts a system](start-system.html). This is a one-time task.
- An AWS account administrator [configures access](configure-access.html) for users. This is a one time task.
- A Datomic user [gets connected](get-connected.html). This task is performed once per client environment (e.g. per developer machine).
