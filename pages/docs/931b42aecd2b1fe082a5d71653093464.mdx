Connecting
==========

This page covers:

- [connecting to the access gateway](#connect)
- [testing the analytics connection](#test)

Prerequisites
-------------

This page assumes that an administrator has already:

- [started a Datomic System](../getting-started/start-system.html)
- [configured user access](../getting-started/configure-access.html)
- [configured analytics](analytics-configuring.html)

Before you connect, you need to:

- Install the [AWS CLI](../operation/howto.html#install-cli) version 1.11.170 or greater.
- Install the [Datomic CLI Tools](../operation/cli-tools.html)
- Configure a shell environment with [AWS access keys](../operation/howto.html#aws-access-keys) for Datomic
- Know the [region and name](../operation/howto.html#system-name) of the Datomic System you want to connect to





Connecting
----------

Use the [datomic tools](../operation/cli-tools.html#analytics) to create an analytics connection, passing in the arguments `analytics` and your Datomic [system name](../operation/howto.html#system-name).

```
<pre class="example" id="orgbb96664">
datomic analytics access <system-name>
```





Testing Your Connection
-----------------------

You should test your analytics connection in two different ways:

- Browse to the analytics dashboard by visiting [localhost:8989](http://localhost:8989) in a web browser. You should see a monitoring dashboard.
- Install the [SQL CLI](analytics-cli.html) and use it to validate your configuration.

Once you have verified your connection via the dashboard and the SQL CLI, you can explore your data from the CLI or setup and run the [analytics tools](analytics-tools.html) of your choice.
