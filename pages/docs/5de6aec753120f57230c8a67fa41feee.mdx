Datomic Properties Files
========================

Example property files are in the config/samples directory of the Datomic distribution.

Reading Properties Files
------------------------

Each property has a comment describing its use, plus one or more of the tags below:

property tagmeaningrequiredno reasonable default, you must set this propertydefaultedsetup will default this property for yougeneratedsetup will generate a unique value for youoptionalproperty is not required



Understanding "Ensure" Commands
-------------------------------

Some datomic command names start with "ensure", e.g. "ensure-transactor" and "ensure-cf". Ensure commands work as follows:

- Take at least two property file arguments: input and output
- Attempt to save a valid, complete properties file in output
- Can apply defaults and provision new objects
- Report anything short of "ready to go" as errors on the console

Ensure commands are idempotent. Calling an ensure command on a complete, valid properties file is a no-op, and will produce an output file identical to the input file.
