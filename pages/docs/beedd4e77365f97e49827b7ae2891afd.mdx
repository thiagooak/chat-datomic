Monitoring
==========

AWS CloudWatch provides a powerful set of tools for monitoring a software system running on AWS:

- You can collect and track [CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) â€“ variables that measure the behavior of your system.
- You can configure [CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) to notify operations or take other automated steps when potential problems arise.
- You can monitor, store, and search [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) across all your AWS resources.
- You can create [CloudWatch Dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html) that provide a single overview for monitoring your systems.

Datomic is fully integrated with all of these AWS monitoring tools. On the producing side, Datomic creates [metrics](#metrics) and [logs](#logs); and on the consuming side, Datomic organizes metrics in [custom dashboards](#dashboards). This document shows how to manage and monitor your Datomic system.

Finding Datomic Resources by Tag
--------------------------------

Datomic tags resources it creates with the following tag:

Tag NameTag ValueResources Taggeddatomic:systemSystem Nameall taggable resourcesYou can use this tag to locate all the resources associated with a Datomic system. From the [Tag Editor:](https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/tag-editor/find-resources)

1. Under **Regions**, Enter one or more AWS regions
2. Under **Resource types**, choose "All resource types"
3. Under **Tags**, choose the name "datomic:system" for tag key
4. Under the same row in **Tags**, enter a specific System Name for tag value, or leave the tag value blank to find resources for all Datomic Systems.

Searching CloudWatch Logs
-------------------------



### CLI Tool

The [CLI Tools](cli-tools.html) allow you to [list log messages](cli-tools.html#log-list) and [show detail for specific messages](cli-tools.html#log-detail) without necessitating a trip to the AWS console.





### AWS Console

If you need to view the CloudWatch Logs for a Datomic system:

- Open the [CloudWatch Logs](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs:) in the AWS Console
- Click on the Log Group named "datomic-{System}", where System is your system name

Each EC2 instance will create a separate log stream. Usually you will want to search across all log streams:

- click the "Search Log Group" button
- click to the right of the filter box to choose an appropriate time window
- enter a metric filter pattern to scope your search



- <a id="finding-alerts"></a>Finding Alerts  
    The search pattern "Alert - Alerts" will find the text of every alert produced by Datomic. The "Alert" matches each alert, and the "- Alerts" filters redundant summary messages.
    
    The example below demonstrates reviewing a week's worth of alerts. The single event that matches is a transient DynamoDB request failure, so not a problem.

### Finding Logs By Message



- <a id="finding-logs-cli"></a>CLI Tool  
    The [CLI Tools](cli-tools.html) allow you to [list logs](cli-tools.html#log-list) between a starting time `--tod` and a number of minutes in the past `--minutes-back`.
    
    The `datomic log list` command can be piped to grep with the `-B 1` option to be used to find specific logs for a given time period:
    
    ```
    <pre class="example" id="org4a309eb">
    datomic log list my-datomic-system \
    -f all --tod 2019-06-24T03:41:23.491 --minutes-back 150 \
    | grep -B 1 CloudWatchMetrics
    ```
    
    The preceding command will find all logs labeled "CloudWatchMetrics" from March 6th, 2019, 1:11:23.491am until March 6th, 2019, 3:41:23.491am.
- <a id="finding-logs-aws"></a>AWS Console  
    The image below shows using the CloudWatch [Filter and Pattern Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html) to find all logs whose `Msg` is "CodeDeployEvent".
    
    
    - The brackets `{}` identify the query as a [JSON metric filter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html)
    - the `$` is a placeholder for log entry as a whole
    - the dot syntax scopes the search to the individual key `Msg`

Metrics Produced by Datomic Cloud
---------------------------------

Datomic compute nodes publish Cloudwatch Metrics as follows:

- namespace is *DatomicCloud*
- dimensions are your system name and your compute stack name

Datomic reports a large number of distinct metrics, many of which are useful primarily for Datomic support. The most useful metrics for operators fall into three categories:

- Troubleshooting metrics are helpful for [troubleshooting problems](../troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-nodes).
- Request metrics measure the request load on a system, and can act as [autoscaling triggers](growing-your-system.html#autoscaling-triggers) for query groups.
- Capacity metrics measure the size of database and indexes, and are helpful in [sizing your primary compute group](growing-your-system.html#primary-compute-group).

These key metrics are summarized below.

Logs Produced by Datomic Cloud
------------------------------

Datomic writes Cloudwatch Logs as follows:

- The "Log Group" name is the name of the Datomic System.
- Each EC instance will create a log stream named by the convention *{system}-{group}-{instance-id}-{timestamp}*.





Datomic Cloud Dashboards
------------------------

When you launch a compute group, it automatically creates a dashboard named `datomic-(name)-(region)` that you can view in the AWS Console.

The [primary compute stack](../whatis/architecture.html#primary-compute-resources) creates a large dashboard, suitable for viewing on a large ops monitor screen:

[![production-dashboard.png](../images/production-dashboard.png)](../images/production-dashboard.png)



Each dashboard widget tells a story. For example, the DynamoDB Usage widget tracks [DynamoDB AutoScaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AutoScaling.html) of reads (left axis) and writes (right axis). In the image below you can see DynamoDB write provisioning (the green line) scaling up for a four-hour period during a batch load, and then scaling back down to almost nothing.

[![ddb-autoscaling.png](../images/ddb-autoscaling.png)](../images/ddb-autoscaling.png)



A query group stack creates dashboard that is a subset of the information shown for a primary compute group.
