Ions Tutorial
=============

Cleanup
-------

If you wish to [delete your Datomic Cloud system](../operation/deleting.html) after you've deployed an Ion, then you must first deploy an Ion with an `resources/datomic/ion-config.edn` that consists of a map of the `:app-name`of your application.

Change your `resources/datomic/ion-config.edn` to the following map, and replace `:app-name` with your application name.

```clojure
{:app-name "app-name"}
```



Now [push](push-and-deploy.html#push) and [deploy](push-and-deploy.html#deploy).

Once this ion-config.edn is deployed, the Datomic Cloud system can [be deleted](../operation/deleting.html).





Conclusion
----------

In this tutorial, you have seen how ions can take ordinary Clojure functions, and install them in Datomic Cloud where they have in-memory access to Datomic data. You have used ions to deliver:

- [a data-driven application via AWS Lambda](entry-points.html#invoke-lambda)
- [attribute predicates](entry-points.html#attribute-predicate)
- [a web service via API Gateway](entry-points.html#http-direct)

There is a lot more to explore! Here are some things to try:

- Use ions to implement a lambda that [handles events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-services.html) from other AWS services. See the [ion-event-example](https://github.com/datomic/ion-event-example) project.
- Instead of wiring a web handler to a single function, use a routing library such as [Compojure](https://jacobobryant.com/post/2019/ion/) or [pedestal](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal.ions).
