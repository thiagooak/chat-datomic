Reserved Instances
==================

The ongoing cost for running Datomic EC2 instances can be reduced by purchasing AWS [Reserved Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/reserved-instances/) (RIs).

Once you have reviewed [Growing your System](../operation/growing-your-system.html), you can purchase Reserved Instances for the [EC2 instances types](../operation/growing-your-system.html#instance-sizes) used in your system. AWS will automatically apply the purchased RI discount to your infrastructure (EC2) cost for any instances matching the purchased RI attributes.

Determining Instance Sizes
--------------------------

Standard RIs are purchased for a specific EC2 instance type. You can determine the type(s) and quantities of EC2 instances your Datomic system uses by [searching for the keyword 'datomic' in your EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Instances:search=datomic;sort=desc:launchTime):

Note the instance type(s) and number of instances running in your system. You can purchase RIs for any or all of the Datomic system instances.





Purchasing Reserved Instances
-----------------------------

Browse to the ['Reserved Instances' section of the EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#ReservedInstances:sort=reservedInstancesId) and click the "Purchase Reserved Instances" button:

In the popup dialog, enter your desired RI search parameters and click the "Search" button. This example demonstrates searching for RIs for t3.small instances for a 12 month term:

Generally, options with higher upfront costs provide greater hourly discounts.

RIs will be automatically applied to running instance(s) matching the purchased RI attributes.
