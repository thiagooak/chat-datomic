Configurations and Pricing
==========================

When you start a Datomic system, you will make two choices that determine the capacity and base price of your system:

- the compute instance type
- the cluster size (number of compute instances)

The table below shows the impact of the these choices. The columns show instance size, and the rows show the capacity of each instance, as well as the monthly [base price](../operation/growing-your-system.html#understanding-bill) of running each instance type at a cluster size of one or two instances.

- Two instances are necessary only if you require high availability.
- AWS EC2 instance pricing is on-demand by default. You can switch to EC2 reserved capacity at any time (before or after starting Datomic).
- If you are uncertain how much capacity you need, start with the defaults. You can change the instance type or cluster size at any time later as your needs change.

The table above summarizes all you need to know to [start your first system](../getting-started/start-system.html). For more details, and a number of more advanced options, see [growing your system](../operation/growing-your-system.html).
