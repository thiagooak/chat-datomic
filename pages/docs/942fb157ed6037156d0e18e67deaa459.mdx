Connect to a Database
=====================

This guide uses the Datomic [Peer library](../peer/peer-introduction.html). Instructions for using this guide with the [Client Library](../client/integrating-client-lib.html) are located in the [Client library getting started guide](../client/client-getting-started.html). Review [differences between](../overview/clients-and-peers.html) the Peer and Client libraries.

Creating a database
-------------------

[Setup your project](../peer/integrating-peer-lib.html) or run the [included REPL](dev-setup.html#repl). If you wish to persist your changes to disk then [run a transactor](transactor.html) and use the transactor's database URI below.

Include the Peer API:

```clojure
(require '[datomic.api :as d])
```



```clojure
=>
nil
```



Create the URI that allows you to create and connect to a database.

An in-memory database URI will have three parts:

- `datomic:`, identifying it as a Datomic URI
- `mem://`, the mem storage protocol that uses local memory instead of a persistent store
- `hello`, the name of the database

If you [ran a transactor to use local storage](dev-setup.html#run-dev-transactor) then supply the database uri that was supplied when you passed the `-Ddatomic.printConnectionInfo=true` flag. Replace `<DB_NAME>`with the name of the database that you want to create:

Bind a var, `db-uri`, to the value of the URI:

```clojure
(def db-uri "datomic:mem://hello")

;; If you're using local dev storage, use the db uri you created earlier.
;; replace <DB-NAME> with your database name. It will look similar to:
;; (def db-uri "datomic:dev://localhost:4334/hello")
```



```clojure
=>
#'user/db-uri
```



Create the "hello" database using the `create-database` function:

```clojure
(d/create-database db-uri)
```



```clojure
=>
true
```







Create a connection
-------------------

Once you have [created a database](#create-db), you can use the Datomic Peer Library to interact with it.

Connect to the transactor in the same REPL that you used to create your database:

```clojure
(def conn (d/connect db-uri))
```



```clojure
=>
#'user/conn
```



You should see that a var was created called `conn` which is holding your database connection. You can inspect it:

```clojure
conn
```



```clojure
=> #object[datomic.peer.LocalConnection 0x6ca372ef "datomic.peer.LocalConnection@6ca372ef"]
```



Any transactions submitted to the connection will be persisted to the storage that you chose when creating your database.

Try adding a new entity with the `:db/doc` value "Hello world".

```clojure
@(d/transact conn [{:db/doc "Hello world"}])
```



```clojure
=>
{:db-before datomic.db.Db@33e08f8b, :db-after datomic.db.Db@7957bcc8, :tx-data [#datom[13194139534312 50 #inst "2022-03-18T09:33:18.156-00:00" 13194139534312 true] #datom[17592186045417 62 "Hello world" 13194139534312 true]], :tempids {-9223301668109598134 17592186045417}}
```







Interact with Datomic
---------------------

The next step will be to define some [schema for your new database](transact-schema.html).
