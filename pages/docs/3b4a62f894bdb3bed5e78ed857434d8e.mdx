Using Superset
==============

[Superset](https://superset.apache.org) is an open-source business intelligence and data analytics platform that provides numerous statistical and visualization tools. You can configure Superset to use Datomic as a data source via the included "presto" connector.

**Important**: First, follow the steps in the [Python Setup](analytics-python.html) documentation.

Installing Superset
-------------------

Using the venv [created previously](analytics-python.html#setup-venv):

- From the directory created when making the venv (my-python-env):

```example
. venv/bin/activate
```



Follow the [superset install and setup instructions](https://superset.apache.org/installation.html) in your Python `venv`, starting with: `pip install superset`

Once installed, as indicated in the docs, you can launch superset with:

```example
superset run -p 8080 --with-threads --reload --debugger
```



Use `Ctrl-C` to stop the superset server

These setup steps only need to be run the first time you install Superset.

To run it again in the future, return to the my-python-env directory and run:

```

. venv/bin/activate
superset run -p 8080 --with-threads --reload --debugger
```

Once Superset is running, it can be found at localhost:8080 in a web browser.





Using Superset with Datomic Analytics
-------------------------------------

In the Superset Menu Bar Click "Sources" â†’ "Databases" Click the + button to add a new database Choose a name for the DB and enter it in the Name field. In the SQL Alchemy URI field add the DB URI for the Datomic Analytics system:

```example
presto://<host>:<port>/<catalog>/<schema>
```



Substituting `host`, `port`, `catalog`, and `schema`.

Click "Test" to test the connection

Check the "Expose in SQL Lab" Option

Configure remaining options (if desired) and click Save to create the Data Source
