Get Connected
=============

> This page only applies to [Datomic 781-9041](../changes.html#781-9041) and lower.

This page walks your through configuring Client API connectivity to a Datomic system from outside the Datomic VPC. This takes two steps:

- [connect to the access gateway](../operation/cli-tools.html#client-access)
- [test the access gateway connection](#test-access-gateway)

> The latest Datomic Cloud [setup process](start-system.html) does not require these steps.

Prerequisites
-------------

This page assumes that an administrator has already:

- [started a Datomic System](../getting-started/start-system.html)
- [configured user access](../getting-started/configure-access.html)

Before you configure Client API connectivity to a Datomic database from outside the VPC, you need to:

- Install [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) 1.9 or later.
- Install the [AWS CLI](../operation/howto.html#install-cli) version 1.11.170 or greater.
- Install the [Datomic CLI Tools](../operation/cli-tools.html)
- Configure a shell environment with [AWS access keys](../operation/howto.html#aws-access-keys) for Datomic
- Know the [region and name](../operation/howto.html#system-name) of the Datomic System you want to connect to





Connect to the Access Gateway
-----------------------------

To connect to the access gateway, run the [datomic access](../operation/cli-tools.html#client-access) command to create an SOCKS proxy connection, passing your [system name](../operation/howto.html#system-name):

```

datomic client access <system>
```

The script will continue to run once launched.





Test Access Gateway Connection
------------------------------

Run the following command to test your system's ability to reach Datomic through the SOCKS proxy, replacing `[system]`, `[region]`. and `[port]` with your [system-name, region](../operation/howto.html#system-name) and port.

```

curl -x socks5h://localhost:8182 http://entry.[system].[region].datomic.net:8182/
```

On success, this command will return text like:

```

{:s3-auth-path [bucket-name]}
```

Any other response indicates a failure to connect. Carefully review the prerequisites and steps on this page. If you feel that you have completed each step correctly, see the [troubleshooting documentation](../troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-socks).

If you are trying Datomic for the first time, a good next step is the [Client API Tutorial](../tutorial/client.html).
