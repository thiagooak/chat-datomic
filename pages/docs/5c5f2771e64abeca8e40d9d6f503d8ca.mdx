Valcache
========

Everything gets better when data moves closer to processing. Datomic Valcache is a local, immutable, high capacity, durable, SSD-backed, low latency cache for Datomic.

- Valcache is transparent to application code.
- Valcache caches segments of [index](../query/indexes.html#efficient-accumulation) and [log](../api/log.html#implementation), which are immutable values that never expire.
- Valcache runs on the same instance as a Datomic process, serving that process.
- Valcache is backed by an SSD, providing higher capacity per price than a memory-backed cache.
- Valcache stays hot across process restarts.
- Valcache reduces the load placed on storage, which is particularly helpful for provisioned storages such as DynamoDB.

Prerequisites
-------------

Valcache relies on an SSD with the `strictatime` and `lazytime` flags set. When you mount an SSD for Valcache, you **must** set the `strictatime` and `lazytime` flags.





Configuration
-------------

To configure Valcache you need to set properties in your [transactor](../overview/transactor.html)properties file (for transactors) or set Java [system properties](../configuration/system-properties.html) (for peers):

```



Peer example:

```
<pre class="src src-example">java -Ddatomic.valcachePath=/opt/valcache/ -Ddatomic.valcacheMaxGb=100 {your-args}
```







Monitoring Valcache
-------------------

Valcache entries in the operational [log](../configuration/configuring-logging.html) begin with `:valcache`. In particular, you can search for `:valcache/start` to see the settings used to launch Valcache.

The `Valcache` metric can be use to monitor Valcache utilization and performance.

Valcache vs. Memcached
----------------------

You can choose [memcached](../overview/caching.html#memcached) instead of Valcache, and you can make this choice independently per process.

When used in Datomic, memcached differs from Valcache in that

- Memcached can run on separate instances, with lifecycles independent of transactor and peer processes.
- Memcached can be clustered.
- Memcached is not specific to Datomic, and can support Datomic while simultaneously serving other clients.

We believe that for most Datomic usage, Valcache will be more effective than memcached, providing a larger, hotter cache with similar latency at a lower price. However, if your deployment strategy prevents new processes from using existing SSDs, memcached may be a better fit. Two common cases for this are:

- Your peer or transactor instances do not have SSDs.
- New processes cannot reuse SSDs that were populated by a previous process. This is often the case in cloud deployment, where instances and their disks are ephemeral. (If you are running on AWS, check out [Datomic Cloud](https://www.datomic.com/index.html) which uses Valcache automatically.)
