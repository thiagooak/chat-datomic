Use :db/ident for Enumerations
------------------------------

Many databases need to represent a set of enumerated values. In Datomic, it's idiomatic to represent enumerated values as entities with a *:db/ident* attribute.

For example, this transaction defines an *:artist/country* attribute, and two initial enumerated values, *:country/CA* and *:country/JP*, ISO alpha-2 country codes for Canada and Japan.

```clojure
[{:db/ident :artist/country
  :db/valueType :db.type/ref
  :db/cardinality :db.cardinality/one
  :db/doc "An artist's country of residence"}

 {:db/ident :country/CA}

 {:db/ident :country/JP}]
```



The use of *:db/ident* on the enumerated value entities makes it possible to refer to the entities using their identity keywords, *:country/CA* and *:country/JP*, respectively.

This transaction creates an artist named "Leonard Cohen" with the country *:country/CA*.

```clojure
[{:artist/name "Leonard Cohen"
  :artist/country :country/CA}]
```



The *:artist/country* attribute is of type *:db.type/ref*, so its value must be a reference to another entity. The *:country/CA*keyword can be used as a value because it is the identity of an entity, as specified by *:db/ident* in the previous transaction.
