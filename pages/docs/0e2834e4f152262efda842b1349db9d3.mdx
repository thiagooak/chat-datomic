Use :db/ident for Enumerations
------------------------------

Many databases need to represent a set of enumerated values. In Datomic, it's idiomatic to represent enumerated values as entities with a *:db/ident* attribute.

For example, this transaction defines an *:artist/country* attribute, and two initial enumerated values, *:country/CA* and *:country/JP*, ISO alpha-2 country codes for Canada and Japan.

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">[{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:artist/country</span>
  <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/valueType</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.type/ref</span>
  <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/cardinality</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.cardinality/one</span>
  <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/doc</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"An artist's country of residence"</span>}

 {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:country/CA</span>}

 {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:country/JP</span>}]
```



The use of *:db/ident* on the enumerated value entities makes it possible to refer to the entities using their identity keywords, *:country/CA* and *:country/JP*, respectively.

This transaction creates an artist named "Leonard Cohen" with the country *:country/CA*.

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">[{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:artist/name</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Leonard Cohen"</span>
  <span style="color: #008b8b;">:artist/country</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:country/CA</span>}]
```



The *:artist/country* attribute is of type *:db.type/ref*, so its value must be a reference to another entity. The *:country/CA*keyword can be used as a value because it is the identity of an entity, as specified by *:db/ident* in the previous transaction.
