Run a Transactor
================

Running a local Transactor
--------------------------

This getting started guide instructs you to use `mem` storage. `mem` storage will store your data in memory and will only persist that data as long as the

The dev storage protocol uses local disk files for storage, and requires a transactor to be running. There are [other storage options](../overview/storage.html) which should be considered for any production environment.

If you wish to try this guide without persisting changes to disk then [use in-memory storage](connect-to-a-database.html#create-db).

Transactor configuration happens at the command line and in the `transactor.properties` file.

The Datomic distribution comes with a sample configuration for `dev` storage. Copy `config/samples/dev-transactor-templates.properties` to another location. This guide will use the `config` directory in your datomic-pro distribution directory:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">cp config/samples/dev-transactor-template.properties config/dev-transactor-template.properties
```



Edit `config/dev-transactor-template.properties` with the text editor of your choice and replace `license=` with the license key sent to you via [My Datomic](https://my.datomic.com/).

> NOTE: The license key is only provided via email and is not the same as the download key shown on the [My Datomic](https://my.datomic.com/) Dashboard. It is sent to you via e-mail and can be resent via the "Sent License Key" button in [My Datomic](https://my.datomic.com/).

You can start a local transactor with dev storage from your system shell as follows:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">bin/transactor -Ddatomic.printConnectionInfo=true config/dev-transactor-template.properties
```



```
<pre class="src src-sh">=>
Launching with Java options -server -Xms1g -Xmx1g  -Ddatomic.printConnectionInfo=true
Starting datomic:dev://localhost:4334/<DB-NAME>, storing data<span style="color: #a020f0;"> in</span>: data ...
System started datomic:dev://localhost:4334/<DB-NAME>, storing data<span style="color: #a020f0;"> in</span>: data  
```



> In production [`datomic.printConnectionInfo=true`](../configuration/system-properties.html#transactor-properties) is a potential liability and should usually be removed to avoid leaking your connection info.

Replace `<DB-NAME>` in the returned connection string with the database name of your choice, for example "hello":

```
<pre class="src src-sh">datomic:dev://localhost:4334/hello
```



If you [use this database URI](connect-to-a-database.html) then this transactor process will be used for the subsequent steps in this guide. Make sure that it's running while you work through this guide.
