Database Values
---------------

Datomic maintains the entire history of your data. From this, you can query against a database value as of a particular point in time.

The *db* API returns the latest database value from a connection.

noslide

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">db</span> (d/db conn))
```



An analogy with source control is helpful here. A Datomic connection references the entire history of your data, analogous to a source code repository. A database value from *db* is analogous to a checkout.





Pull
----

If you know an entity id, you can use the [pull API](../query/query-pull.html) to return information about that entity and related entities. Better still, if the entity has a unique attribute, you do not even need to know its entity id. A [lookup ref](../whatis/data-model.html#lookup-refs) is a two element list of unique attribute + value that uniquely identifies an entity, e.g.

noslide

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/sku</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-42"</span>]
```



The following call pulls the color, type, and size for *SKU-42*.

noslide

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/pull
 (d/db conn)
 [{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/color</span> [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span>]}
  {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/size</span> [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span>]}
  {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/type</span> [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span>]}]
 [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/sku</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-42"</span>])

```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=>
#<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv</span>{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:color</span> #<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db</span>{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:blue</span>}, 
      <span style="color: #008b8b;">:size</span> #<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db</span>{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:large</span>}, 
      <span style="color: #008b8b;">:type</span> #<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db</span>{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:dress</span>}}
```



Note that the arguments and return value of pull are both just ordinary data structures, i.e. lists and maps.



### Database as a value

[Previously when data was transacted](assertion.html#sample-data) the result was stored in `sample-data-transaction`.

`(:db-before sample-data-transaction)` gets the database value before the transaction.

Attempting to pull against the database *before* the transaction shows that the data does not exist in the `db`.

noslide

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/pull
 (<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db-before</span> sample-data-transaction)
 [{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/color</span> [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span>]}
  {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/size</span> [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span>]}
  {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/type</span> [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span>]}]
 [<span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/sku</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-42"</span>])
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=> {}
```



Pulling against the db value in `(:db-after sample-data-transaction)` will pull against a `db` with the data transacted [previously in the tutorial](assertion.html#sample-data).







Query
-----

Storing and retrieving data by unique id is useful, but a database needs also to provide declarative, logic-based query. Datomic uses [Datalog](../whatis/data-model.html#datalog) with negation, which has expressive power similar to SQL + recursion.

The following query finds the skus of all products that share a color with *SKU-42*:

noslide

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/q
 '[<span style="color: #008b8b;">:find</span> ?sku
   <span style="color: #008b8b;">:where</span>
   [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/sku</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-42"</span>]
   [?e <span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/color</span> ?color]
   [?e2 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/color</span> ?color]
   [?e2 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:inv/sku</span> ?sku]]
 db)
```



```
<pre class="src src-clojure">=>
[[<span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-42"</span>] 
 [<span style="color: #8b2252;">"SKU-32"</span>] 
 ...]
```



Note that the arguments and return value of `q` are both just ordinary data structures, i.e. lists and maps.

In the `:where` clauses, each list further constrains the results. For each list:

- the first element matches the entity id
- the second element matches an attribute
- the third element matches an attribute's value

Symbols beginning with a question mark are datalog *variables*. When the same symbol occurs more than once, it causes a join. In the queryabove

- `?e` joins *SKU-42* to its color
- `?e2` joins to all entities sharing the color
- `?sku` retrieves the SKU for every `?e2`

Now we are confident that we can get basic inventory in and out. Just in time, too, because our stakeholders are back with [more feature requests](accumulate.html).
