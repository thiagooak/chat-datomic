Log API
=======

Datomic's database log is a recording of all transaction data in historic order, organized for efficient access by transaction.

tx-range
--------

 You can access the log via the [tx-range API function](https://docs.datomic.com/client-api/datomic.client.api.async.html#var-tx-range).

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/tx-range conn {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:start</span> 1000 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:end</span> 1020})
```



The arguments are *startT* (inclusive), and *endT* (exclusive). Legal values for these arguments are:

- txes (transaction entity ids)
- ts (as e.g. returned from Database.nextT)
- transaction instants (java.util.Dates)
- *nil* (to represent the beginning/end of the log)

*tx-range* returns a collection of transactions, each of which contains key/value pairs:
