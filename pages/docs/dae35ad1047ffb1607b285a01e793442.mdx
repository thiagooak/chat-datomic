Enabling CORS in a Lambda Proxy
===============================

The Problem
-----------

Preflight OPTIONS requests are blocked by CORS policy when using Cognito to authorize requests to an API Gateway HTTP Direct `$default`.





The Solution
------------

- Go to the AWS [API Gateway console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home)
- Select your HTTP Direct API
- Attach your authorizer to your `$default` route and follow the steps to set it up.
- Click Routes.
- Click "Create".
- Create a new `OPTIONS` route with a path of `/{proxy+}`
- Attach your HTTP Direct (port 8184) integration to this path.
- Click CORS.
- Click Configure.
- Configure as required by your application.



### Adding CORS Headers In Your App

With the above change, requests will now be passed to your application which will be responsible for adding the desired CORS headers. A maximally permissive set of headers is provided here as a reference. You may adjust based on your specific needs:

```clojure
(def cors-headers {"Access-Control-Allow-Origin" "*"
                   "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" "GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS"
                   "Access-Control-Allow-Headers" "Authorization, Content-Type"})
```









The Solution (Legacy)
---------------------

> This section only applies to [Datomic 781-9041](../changes.html#781-9041) and lower.

Add an unauthenticated lambda proxy OPTIONS method to your API Gateway. Then add the appropriate cors headers to the request response from within your application.



### Adding The Method

- Go to the AWS [API Gateway console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/home)
- Under the Actions dropdown, choose **Create Method**
- Select **OPTIONS** from the drop-down
- Click the checkmark next to the dropdown box.
- In **Lambda Function**, choose the region and lambda function that proxies to your app.
- Click **Save**
- Under the Actions dropdown, select **Deploy API** and use the next window to deploy your API.
