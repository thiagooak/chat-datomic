Install the AWS CLI
-------------------

[Install the AWS Command Line Interface.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html). Make sure you have version 1.11.170 or later. If you are unfamiliar with managing Python environments, first try using the bundled [AWS CLI installer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-bundle.html). You can check your version using:

```
<pre class="example" id="orgd5bd073">
aws --version
```

**NOTE:** Running the `datomic-socks-proxy` script with an earlier version of the AWS CLI will result in a [generic error message](../troubleshooting.html#unsupported-aws-cli) and failure of the script.

If you require multiple versions of the AWS CLI to be installed, then please investigate [using Python's virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments), or the third-party [virtualenv solution](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).





Manage AWS Access Keys for Datomic
----------------------------------

The Datomic [CLI tools](../operation/cli-tools.html) and [ion deployment tools](../ions/ions-reference.html#deploying) require that you have a set of AWS access keys with permissions to access Datomic. To create these keys, you must have an [authorized IAM user](../getting-started/configure-access.html#authorize-user). With this user you can then:

1. [Create access keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html)
2. [Add access keys to your environment](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#cli-quick-configuration)

Datomic supports the use of [named profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html) as a credentials source. Additional information about IAM Users and access keys can be found in the [AWS Security Credentials documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) .





Install Clojure CLI
-------------------

Datomic's tools use the [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli), version 1.10.1.727 or later. You can use `clojure -Sdescribe` to check your version of the Clojure CLI.

The Clojure [Getting Started](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_clojure_installer_and_cli_tools) page has instructions for installing and upgrading Clojure.





Install ion-dev Tools
---------------------

The Datomic ion-dev tools should be installed via an alias in your [user deps.edn file](https://clojure.org/reference/deps_and_cli#_directories), which is normally located at `$HOME/.clojure/deps.edn`.

To install the tools, add the `datomic-cloud` maven repo under your `:mvn/repos` key:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure"><span style="color: #8b2252;">"datomic-cloud"</span> {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:url</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"s3://datomic-releases-1fc2183a/maven/releases"</span>}
```



Then add an `:ion-dev` entry under your `:aliases` key with the [latest version](../releases.html#current) of ion-dev:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure"><span style="color: #008b8b;">:ion-dev</span>
{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:deps</span> {com.datomic/ion-dev {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:mvn/version</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"1.0.306"</span>}}
 <span style="color: #008b8b;">:main-opts</span> [<span style="color: #8b2252;">"-m"</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"datomic.ion.dev"</span>]}
```



The ions tutorial includes a [complete .clojure/deps.edn example](https://github.com/Datomic/ion-starter/blob/master/examples/.clojure/deps.edn).

Note that `ion-dev` configures logging to stderr via [slf4j-simple](http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/impl/SimpleLogger.html). This is probably adequate for most scenarios, but you of course have the [full power of SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html) at your disposal.





Install ion Library
-------------------

The Datomic ion library should be installed in the deps.edn for each ion project:

Add the `datomic-cloud` maven repo under your `:mvn/repos` key:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure"><span style="color: #8b2252;">"datomic-cloud"</span> {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:url</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"s3://datomic-releases-1fc2183a/maven/releases"</span>}
```



Then add the [latest version](../releases.html#current) of ion-dev to your `:deps`:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">com.datomic/ion {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:mvn/version</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"1.0.62"</span>}
```







Delete Ion lambdas
------------------

You do **not** need to delete the AWS Lambdas managed by Datomic Ions in order to control cost. AWS Lambda pricing is entirely usage-based, so if you do not invoke Lambdas, they cost nothing. If you want to delete these Lambdas anyway, you can [push](../ions/ions-reference.html#push) and [deploy](../ions/ions-reference.html#deploy) an application with an empty `lambdas` map in [ion-config.edn](../ions/ions-reference.html#ion-config).





Control Shell Scripts
---------------------

Some Datomic CLI tools (e.g. the [client access](../operation/cli-tools.html#client-acces)script) continue to run in the foreground once you launch them. For interactive use, the easiest way to manage such tools is simply to kill them with Ctrl-C when they are no longer needed.

If you are building automation around scripts, you can of course use all the ordinary Unix facilities, e.g.

- You can use `pkill [script-name]` to kill a script from another terminal.
- You can use e.g. `nohup [script-command] [script-args] &` to launch a script in the background, directing its output to `nohup.out`. 
    - Currently running processes can be listed with `jobs` and brought to the foreground with `fg $pid` where pid is the process number listed in `jobs`.





Find Datomic System Name
------------------------

Every Datomic system resides in a single AWS region, and has a unique system name within that region. The system name is the Stack Name used to [launch the Datomic storage stack](new-system.html#storage).

If you did not [start Datomic](../getting-started/start-system.html) yourself, you can find the available systems from the CLI or the AWS Console:

- From the CLI, use the [`datomic cloud list-systems`](cli-tools.html#list-systems) command.
- From the console browse to [CloudFormation console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks?filter=active).





Find Datomic Nodes
------------------

You can list the names of all running Datomic nodes using:

- Utilize the [`datomic system list-instances <system>`](cli-tools.html#list-instancnces) command, replacing `<system>` with your system name.

or

- the following [AWS CLI](#install-cli) command, replacing `[region]` with the region you want to query:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">aws ec2 describe-instances --region [region] --filters <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Name=tag-key,Values=datomic:tx-group"</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Name=instance-state-name,Values=running"</span> --query <span style="color: #8b2252;">'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[Tags[?Key==`datomic:system`].Value]'</span> --output text
```







Find Compute Group Name
-----------------------

- If you start a Datomic system with [split stacks](new-system.html), then it has one or more compute groups. A compute group's name is the name of the CloudFormation stack you used to [create the group](new-system.html#compute).
- If you start a system [using the AWS Marketplace template](../getting-started/start-system.html), Datomic generates a unique name for your compute stack based on your [system name](#system-name), of the form `$(SystemName)-Compute-$(GeneratedId)`.

You can query compute groups for a system from the CLI, or browse them in the AWS Console:

- From the CLI, use the [`datomic system list-instances <system>`](cli-tools.html#list-instancnces) command.
- Browse all your CloudFormation stacks in the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks?filter=active).





Find Datomic Application Name
-----------------------------

Every Datomic [compute group](../whatis/architecture.html#system) has an associated [application](../whatis/architecture.html#applications) for ion deployments. You specify the application name when you [create a compute group](new-system.html#compute).

If you did not start the compute group, you can find the application name by browsing to your compute group in the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks?filter=active)and looking for the `ApplicationName` value in the Parameters tab.





Find System S3 Bucket
---------------------

Every Datomic system has its own S3 bucket for configuration and data storage.

You can find this S3 bucket by browsing to the Outputs tab of your [storage stack](new-system.html#storage) in the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks?filter=active&tab=outputs)and looking for the the `S3DatomicArn` output.





Find Ion Code Bucket
--------------------

All Datomic systems in a region share a common S3 bucket for [ion](../ions/ions.html)deployment. This bucket has a `datomic:code` AWS tag.

You can find this bucket by creating a [resource group](https://console.aws.amazon.com/resource-groups/groups/new) in the AWS Console:

- make sure you are working in the region you want to query
- create a tag based resource group
- select a resource type of `AWS::S3::Bucket`
- search for a tag named `datomic:code`
- give you group a name, e.g. `DatomicCodeBucket`
- create your group





Find Template Outputs
---------------------

Datomic's CloudFormation templates create [outputs](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/outputs-section-structure.html) describing the resources that they manage. You can view these outputs in the [CloudFormation console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks?filter=active), or query them from the AWS CLI. The following example query lists the outputs for a stack named "inventory-primary":

```
<pre class="src src-sh">aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name inventory-primary
```



Information about the compute groups of a system can be found using `describe-groups`:

```
<pre class="example" id="org0e8c688">
datomic system describe-groups <system>
```





Upgrade Base Schema
-------------------

Every Datomic database starts with a base schema, whose identifiers are prefixed with `:db`. When the Datomic team enhances the base schema, all databases created with new versions of Datomic get the enhancements automatically.

Existing databases do **not** automatically incorporate enhancements to the base schema. In order to upgrade existing databases to use new base schema, you must first upgrade **all** compute groups (primary and query) to the minimum version of Datomic required for the base schema features you want:

FeatureMinimum Datomic VersionReleasedtuples480-8770June 27, 2019attribute predicates480-8770June 27, 2019entity specs480-8770June 27, 2019db.type/symbol480-8770June 27, 2019One you have upgraded all compute groups, you can upgrade an existing database to use the latest base schema by passing the `:upgrade-schema`action to `administer-system`. For example:

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(d/administer-system client {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db-name</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"movies"</span>
                             <span style="color: #008b8b;">:action</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:upgrade-schema</span>})
```



Upgrading a schema is an idempotent operation, so it will not harm your data to call it more than once. That said, you should treat `administer-system` as a potentially expensive operation. Call it only when you actually need it, not before every call to `connect`.

> Once you have used a base schema feature in a particular database, do **not** run any compute group for that system on versions of Datomic older than the features used. (See table above.)





Legacy
------



### Check System Topology (Legacy)

All Datomic systems include one or more CloudFormation stacks. To check whether a system uses the [Solo or Production topology](../whatis/architecture.html#primary-compute-resources) either:

- Utilize the [`datomic cloud list-systems`](cli-tools.html#list-systems) command.

or

- Find your system's [primary compute group](#compute-group-name) in the CloudFormation console.
- If the CloudFormation template has a `DatomicProductionCompute` key in its Outputs, the system is running the Production topology. If the key is absent, the system is running Solo.





### Convert from Solo to Production (Legacy)

> This section only applies to [Datomic 781-9041](../changes.html#781-9041) and lower.

To update your system from Solo to Production [topology](../whatis/architecture.html#topologies):

- You must be running [split stacks](split-stacks.html).
- Click the name of your solo stack in

 [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks?filter=active).

- Click the "Update" button.

On the following page, select "Specify an Amazon S3 template URL:" and enter the CloudFormation template URL for the latest production template you wish to upgrade to (see [Release page](../releases.html) for the latest production template) and click "Next".

- On the "Specify Details" screen, leave all options unchanged.
- On the "Options" screen, leave all options unchanged.
- On the "Review" screen, click the mandatory checkboxes that you agree with. You may need to scroll down.

Wait for the template to report UPDATE\_COMPLETE. This can take ten or more minutes. You can refresh the CloudFormation dashboard to see progress. In the [EC2 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/) you'll note that two i3.large instances with your stack name are running and a t2.small instance has been terminated. Your production stack is now ready for use.
