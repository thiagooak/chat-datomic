Other Tools
===========

Many additional analytics tools natively support the Presto protocol. When configuring your analytics tool of choice, choose the "presto" connector if it is available. If your tool does not natively support Presto, you can likely still use it with Datomic via the [JDBC Interface](analytics-jdbc.html).
