Setting Up Python
=================

We recommend using a Python virtualenv for any Python-based analytics tools. Python 3 ships with virtualenv by default, however if it is missing in your environment you can install it with your package manager or using pip:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">pip3 install virtualenv
```



Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment
---------------------------------------

Create an new empty directory for your Python environment and cd into it:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">mkdir my-python-env
<span style="color: #483d8b;">cd</span> my-python-env
```



If you do not yet have it, install Python 3 locally:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">brew install python3
```



Set up a Python virtual environment

> This step is only required once, when you first create the virtual environment NOTE: if you have multiple versions of python 3+ installed, you will need to use version 3.6 or greater for the following command (i.e. python3.7 instead of python3):

```
<pre class="src src-sh">python3 -m venv venv
```



You can now start your virtual environment with:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">. venv/bin/activate
```



You will now see a `(venv)` at the front of your terminal prompt This lets you know that you're using this virtual environment

Now update Python tools and install the libraries used by the various python tools:

```
<pre class="src src-sh">pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
pip install <span style="color: #a0522d;">pandas</span>==0.23.4
pip install <span style="color: #a0522d;">sqlalchemy</span>==1.2.18
pip install pyhive[presto]
```



You can exit the venv any time with:

```
<pre class="example">
deactivate
```
