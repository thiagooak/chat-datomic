Using Jupyter Notebook
======================

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an interactive web-based notebook frequently used for data analysis and visualization. You can access data stored in Datomic for analysis in Jupyter Notebook (or any Python-based system) using the [PyHive Presto](https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive) library.

**Important**: First, follow the steps in the [Python Setup](analytics-python.html) documentation.

Installing Jupyter
------------------

Using the venv [created previously](analytics-python.html#setup-venv):

- From the directory created when making the venv (my-python-env):

```sh
. venv/bin/activate
```



- Install Jupyter:

```sh
pip install jupyterlab
```







Using Jupyter Notebook with Datomic Analytics
---------------------------------------------

Start a Jupyter Notebook with:

```
<pre class="example">
jupyter notebook
```

- Browse to the URL reported by this command.
- Create a new Python3 notebook

Use the following configuration to connect to your Datomic Analytics from Jupyter:

```python
from pyhive import presto
conn = presto.connect(
    host='<host>',
    port=<port>,
    catalog='<catalog>',
    schema='<schema>',
    username='presto'
)
cur = conn.cursor()
```



Run a test query.

```python
cur.execute('SELECT * FROM system.runtime.nodes')
print(cur.fetchall())
```
