Defining Attributes
===================

Attributes are defined using the same data model used for application data. That is, attributes are themselves defined by entities with associated attributes.

The following built-in attributes are required to define a new attribute:

- `:db/ident`, a name that is unique within the database
- `:db/cardinality`, specifying whether entities can have one or a set of values for the attribute
- `:db/valueType`, the type allowed for an attribute's value

In addition to these required attributes, there are many optional attributes that can be used to further define your attributes. For a full list of available built-in attributes, see the [Schema Data Reference](schema-reference.html).

> Leading underscores are used for [reverse lookup in pull](../query/query-pull.html#reverse-lookup).
> 
> If your attribute has a leading underscore then you will not be able to use reverse lookup with that attribute.

You define new attributes by submitting a data structure to Datomic as part of a transaction. All the required information for an attribute must be specified in a single transaction, after which the attribute will be immediately available for use.

It is idiomatic to use the [transaction map](../transactions/transaction-data-reference.html#map-form) data structure to define attributes. The example below defines an attribute named `:person/name` of type `:db.type/string` with `:db.cardinality/one`that is intended to capture a person's name.

```
<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">def</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">name-schema</span>
  [{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/ident</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:person/name</span>
    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/valueType</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.type/string</span>
    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/cardinality</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db.cardinality/one</span>
    <span style="color: #008b8b;">:db/doc</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"A person's name"</span>}])

<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">using a connection named conn:</span>
(d/transact conn {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:tx-data</span> name-schema})

<span style="color: #b22222;">;; </span><span style="color: #b22222;">now you can transact names</span>
(d/transact conn {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:tx-data</span> [{<span style="color: #008b8b;">:person/name</span> <span style="color: #8b2252;">"Grace Hopper"</span>}]})
```
