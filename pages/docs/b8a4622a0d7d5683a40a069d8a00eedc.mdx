Client Getting Started
======================

Getting started with the [Client Library](integrating-client-lib.html) is similar to [Getting Started with Peer](../getting-started/connect-to-a-database.html) except for a few differences:

- [Dev setup](#local-dev-setup)
- [Integrate the Client Library](integrating-client-lib.html)
- [Connecting to a Database](#connect-to-a-database)
- [Transacting](#transacting)

Once you have your [development environment](#local-dev-setup) setup and have [connected to a database](#connect-to-a-database).

Local Development Setup
-----------------------

The Datomic Peer Server provides an interface for Datomic [clients](#repl) to access databases. The Peer Server communicates with storage and the Transactor to service both reads from and writes to Datomic databases.

> The tutorial uses the `mem` storage option with Peer Server. A transactor does not need to be running when using `mem`, but a transactor must be running and connected to the storage when using other storages.

Navigate to the root of your Datomic distribution directory then run:

```sh
bin/run -m datomic.peer-server -h localhost -p 8998 -a myaccesskey,mysecret -d hello,datomic:mem://hello
```



This starts a Peer Server with:

FlagNameValueDescription`-h`Host`localhost`the hostname`-p`Port`8998`the port to listen on`-a`Access key`myaccesskey`an access key (you will this pass back to the Peer Server later to authenticate yourself)`-a`Secret`mysecret`an secret (you will this pass back to the Peer Server later to authenticate yourself)`-d`storage`hello`a URL describing what storage to use and a database nameThe tutorial will use the `mem` storage. `mem` stores the data in memory and does not persist beyond the life of the process.

More details on configuration and options can be found on the [Peer Server](../client/peer-server.html)documentation page.

The Peer Server process will lock the terminal will to this Peer Server process until the process is killed. CTRL-C will kill the process, or you can close the terminal window.

Continuing with the tutorial with client will require a running Peer Server.



### Integrate Client Library

The Client library must be integrated in your project. [Follow the instructions for your preferred project type](integrating-client-lib.html)

Follow the instructions until you have a running REPL.







Connect to a Database
---------------------

The Datomic Client Library communicates with a Peer Server. If you have not yet started a Peer Server, follow the [Local Development Setup](#local-dev-setup) section prior to attempting to connect a Datomic Client.

The first step to interacting with Datomic via the Client API is creating a client with [`datomic.client.api/client`](../../client-api/datomic.client.api.html#var-connect).

Then create a connection with [`datomic.client.api/connect`](../../client-api/datomic.client.api.html#var-connect)by passing in the client and a database name.

Creating a client requires several important parameters:

- `:db-name` is the database your Client code will be interacting with.
- `:endpoint` is the host and port where Datomic is running and listening.
- `:secret` and `:access-key` are two opaque strings that match similar tokens provided when launching Datomic. They are set to "mysecret" and "myaccesskey" in this tutorial.

[`datomic.client.api/client`](../../client-api/datomic.client.api.html#var-connect) takes a map with your client configuration.

```clojure
(def cfg {:server-type :peer-server
          :access-key "myaccesskey"
          :secret "mysecret"
          :endpoint "localhost:8998"
          :validate-hostnames false})
```



```clojure
=> #'user/cfg
```



Create a client:

```clojure
(def client (d/client cfg))
```



```clojure
=> #'user/client
```



Create a connection with that client:

```clojure
(def conn (d/connect client {:db-name "hello"}))
```



```clojure
=> #'user/conn
```



You should see that a var was created called "`conn`" which is holding your database connection. You can inspect it:

```clojure
conn
```



```clojure
=> {:db-name "hello", 
    :database-id "5a381758-6e47-4504-aa08-07067b5c241a", 
    :t 1008, 
    :next-t 1009, 
    :type :datomic.client/conn}
```



This tells you that you have an available connection to the database called "hello" as well as a few other details which you will learn more about later. You can now use "conn" as an input to future commands.





Connecting
----------

The Client API [`connect`](../../client-api/datomic.client.api.html#var-connect) takes a [client object](../../client-api/index.html) and a map with a key of `:db-name` the value of the database that you want to connect to.

```
<pre class="example">
(def cfg {:server-type :peer-server
	:access-key "myaccesskey"
	:secret "mysecret"
	:endpoint "localhost:8998"
	:validate-hostnames false})
```

```
<pre class="example">
=>
#+user/cfg
```

```
<pre class="example">
(def client (d/client cfg))
```

```
<pre class="example">
=>
#'user/client
```

```
<pre class="example">
(def conn (d/connect client {:db-name "hello"}))
```

```
<pre class="example">
=>
#'user/conn
```

Now your connection can be used similar to how it is in the [Peer Getting Started](../getting-started/get-datomic.html).





Transacting
-----------

The Client library's `transact` function takes the transaction data in a map under the key `:tx-data`.

> `movie-schema` is defined in the Peer [Getting Started](../getting-started/get-datomic.html) section. Follow that guide, starting from "[Transacting Schema](../getting-started/transact-schema.html)" with these modifications to learn about using Client.

```clojure
(d/transact conn {:tx-data movie-schema})
```



```clojure
=>
{:db-before {:database-id "58a47389-f1ab-4d81-85b6-715cecde9bac", 
             :t 63, 
             :next-t 1000, 
             :history false}, 
 :db-after {:database-id "58a47389-f1ab-4d81-85b6-715cecde9bac", 
            :t 1000, 
            :next-t 1001, 
            :history false}, 
 :tx-data [ #datom[13194139534312 50 #inst "2017-02-15T15:28:31.174-00:00" 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[63 10 :movie/title 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[63 40 23 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[63 41 35 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[63 62 "The title of the movie" 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[64 10 :movie/genre 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[64 40 23 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[64 41 35 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[64 62 "The genre of the movie" 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[65 10 :movie/release-year 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[65 40 22 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[65 41 35 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[65 62 "The year the movie was released in theaters" 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[0 13 65 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[0 13 64 13194139534312 true] 
            #datom[0 13 63 13194139534312 true]], 
 :tempids {-9223301668109598144 63, -9223301668109598143 64, -9223301668109598142 65}}
```



This is in contrast to the [Peer](../getting-started/transact-schema.html) library. [Peer's `transact`](../clojure/index.html#datomic.ap/transact) takes the tx-data directly and returns a future which must be clojure.core/derefed.

The rest of the [Getting Started](../getting-started/transact-schema.html) guide applies to the Client library with this difference in mind.
